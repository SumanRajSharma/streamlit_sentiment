SHILL
Everyone who is here should take their viewership and subs to louis. I dont know him persinally and just found his videos a few months aho and hes the real deal. 100% honest and not a shill like this guy has become. This dude had apples nards in his mouth
after all this talk about always giving honest reviews and never bending for a company i just feel lied to. smh 🤦
Sadly Marques has been captured by the Apple Reality Distortion Field™.
Or; how many words can he say without saying anything.
"Me, who taught you were the real deal? Everybody can be bought 💯. The money 💰, is okay. But please just stop saying you are real. Thanks for the past when I still really believed in you. Good Lobbying 👍."
How did he bot over 100k likes?
I knew KBHD  was an apple propaganda billboard when he equated the iPhoneSE battery to the Pocofone. Shameless man.
"Louis Rossman brought me here,  😂😂😂😂."
Oh no!!! I can’t believe it 😖. It’s true… “Sold!”
"guys to get Tim cook to do this interview , You cant be a journalist .... this is Trillion dollar business bad news is billions in stock drops"
Can you please investigate. I can see the metaverse and spatial computing without hardware and through biotechnology medicine. I quit my job because of this medicine. I worked at Intel at the time and it happened at UPMC. Who owns the patents and why wasn’t I paid. It’s worth trillions. Imagine seeing it without hardware.
Youtube diversity consultant misses entire point of what an interview should be.  Instead moves into pushing corporate propaganda.
&quot;Interview&quot; would be an incorrect description of this pathetic video.
So interesting to watch two liars talk to each other in their own lying facade bubble 🤯🤣
How much did they pay you? Cuz lets be honest.. THE only thing apple is good at is the Iphone Camera APP.. other than that YOU know they suck! This is nothing but propaganda for a company that DOESNT give a shit.
😂
propaganda
these are the softest questions I have ever seen. way to sellout
What a propaganda shit..
Apple propaganda.
You hate to see your favorite YouTubers become Shills 😔
"This what maintaining a &quot;good relationship&quot; with the corporate overlords will get you - cringy puff pieces. Shows MKBHD did good on the Rabbit fiasco only because they were small potatoes. Punch up once, ffs."
Listening to Tim for more than 5 Minutes makes me fall asleep.. 😆Still waiting to buy my 1st MBA in the future.
This is almost as worse as a scripted Joe Biden interview
Give the greedy lying CEO more softballs while you&#39;re at it
shame on you!
"I honestly hate content like this, maybe you can put these types of content not in the main channel."
"What is due is due - he doesn&#39;t seem to remove negative comments - props. 123K positives vs 17K negatives (as of 2024/07/08). Also, I&#39;m here from Louis Rossman&#39;s video 😆"
"A few weeks before this video you try to claim you are &quot;for consumers&quot; by shitting on some AI product (which I am not defending, they are bad/useless), a few weeks later, you try to shill so bad for a 3 trillion dollar company"
This is just apple add
So it&#39;s confirmed now you are one of the official ambassador of Apple
"Unsubbed, juat can&#39;t take the lying anymore"
"You have no shortage of money and you grew up not poor, really. So it&#39;s not like you need to kiss Apple&#39;s a** for money. In fact, given your subscriber count, you have a responsibility to do the right thing. Instead, you lose your spine in a sad manner?"
"Like, no vision at all T.C.. what a bore.."
"I think y&#39;all are reachiing on the scripted part...speciifically he&#39;s asking about AI. Just because you didn&#39;t want him to grill Tim Cook about a different topic, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s advertising for them."
Sell out
"If Apple cares so much about Privacy and Security, why are advertising analytics a core feature of their OS? Why does iCloud leak deleted data? Why does Apple even consider scanning its customers’ personal, on-device photos and videos to send to law enforcement via means of mass surveillance? Why does Apple do nothing release after release to stop spyware, such as Pegasus spyware, from infecting its devices far more than its competitors?"
"This content is trash, but hey, you&#39;re getting engagement so what do you care?"
"I wasn&#39;t some fanatic subscriber, but now I won&#39;t be one at all 🙂"
We got 16 min of mkbhd apple ad before GTA 6
"Love my new Apple Ipad Pro M4,  I am normally not an Apple user."
"You’ve gotten way too close to these companies, man"
Booohhhhh
Apple Propaganda
"this is very rightfully , one of the most videos on youtube ."
Relax with all the hard questions my dude... God forbid apple don&#39;t like you
AH BUT INTEGRITY AND BAD REVIEWS YES
"Oh well <br>That’s disappointing…<br>This is not journalism, this is corporate propaganda"
shill
MkBHD more L’s 🤡🌎
Why didn&#39;t you ask him about Apple blocking third party repair from purchasing spare parts? You sold your morals.
You don&#39;t talk to former President&#39;s and CEO&#39;s of Trillion dollar companies being an honest person
So marques is a sellout.
I think the set they recorded in is quite nicely designed 👌
"So bad,  total marketing propaganda!"
<b>CORPORATE SHILLING</b> IS VERY HIGH ON THIS BOYS !!!!!<br>WE BECOMING APPLE 🍎 ~SHILL~  GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS ONE🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
AS LOUIS ROSSMAN WOULD SAY: GARGLE ON MY BALLS.....🗿🗿🗿<br><br>UNREPAIRABILITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH &quot;LONGEVITY&quot; <br>THEN WHY IPHONE 6  THEN IPHONE 7 HAD THE SAME ISSUE AND NOT COVERED IN THE WARRANTY!!???<br><br>SIMPLY TWIST THE FACTS ABOUT APPLE NOT CARING ABOUT THE END USER TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE COMPANY.. ... SHAME🤷🤷🤷
"Apple is a Publicly traded company. This means that Apple gets investments from investor. As a publicly traded company their sole purpose in existing is making as much profit for their investors as possible.<br><br>That&#39;s why they make decisions like removing headphone jack, supporting anti-repair feature, increasing prices etc. They will do anything even illegal thing (As long is the fine is not too high and the punishment is low) in order to increase profits."
Rich people are so savvy with dancing around questions that it takes skill to properly notice..
NO response from MKBHD? Gargle Louis Rossmans balls hahaha
What a fucking joke.
Marques is exactly like Apple. No substance. No knowledge. Just marketing.
You either die as a hero or live long enough to become an apple employee.
If you wanted to retire on a big fat paycheck from Apple maybe you just told all the people who make you rich (your viewers).
&quot;You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.&quot;
"I dont watch MKBHD or Rossman but i have been led here because of this. But seriously Magic Mouse and ergonomics? Said that 💩 straight faced. Always amazes me how far behind Apple is in the phone world. Tim talks but doesn&#39;t answer anything. He said one thing that was correct, their objective is never to be first."
Are all these apple videos to pay for a fisker lawsuit or divorce?
"I hope the cheque was fat for this one, Marques…"
You&#39;ve been such a good tech YouTuber. Sad to see you become a sellout. Louis Rossmann is absolutely right.
There goes my respect for MKBHD. Propaganda piece from apple. didn&#39;t ask anything worth while.
"Paid apple shill being paid to shill for apple, time to give up on your channel bro, it’s lost any value it had"
Hope the bag was worth it. Filtering soulless corpo videos now.
"They say communist propaganda was the worst, oh Lord behold the almighty APPLE PROPPAGANDA!"
"This guy gets to 19 million subscribers and instead of using his influence to call out BS of Apple and such companies and side with the average end user, he decides to become acquiescent to this fruit name company. What a weird thing to do. It&#39;s not like this guy lacks money, he is made of f**kin money and yet lacks a spine."
Came from Louis Rossmans video to see if he was right…yes.yes he was. Please don’t facilitate this stuff Marquez. Right to repair is for everyone
MARWUES SMIRK AT TIM TALKING ABOUT HOW ERGONOMIC THE MAGIC MOUSE IS IS SENDING ME
so many likes lol bahahahaha
&quot;Uncovering Every Lie in MKBHD&#39;s Softball Interview; a scathing critique of &#39;brand safe&#39; influencers&quot; by Louis Rossmann
These negative comments tell me everything I need to know about people understanding of how interviews work.
Didnt you used to be pro repair? I guess its hard to turn down those apple checks. More disappointing than anything.  Another one falls to the corporate overlord apple.
😂no way this dude has shit on apple about repairability for years and then tim cook gives him a check and he rolls over like a dog.
"Cybertruck review made me question most of MKBHD, this was the final nail in the coffin..."
Imagine being a propaganda guy. Bros way too close to these companies.
Sad to see.  I unsubscribed
Propaganda it is.
Markezz turned his channel into one big ad.
"Markez, very disappointed in your complete absence of objectivity."
Came here after Rossman’s video. I’m ashamed to admit that I didn’t realise that I was being gaslit.
Apple propaganda pt. 2
Marques The short-sighted hypocrite. Not everyone can afford to buy new phones every year and throw the one from just a year ago away. Advocate for Right to Repair.
"Marques Brownlee is a typical sellout, like I said before. All you see on his channel are ads, not informative videos."
Propaganda!!!
I bet no one at apple is using a magic mouse because of the ergonomics
"I watched this when it first came out, It still doesn&#39;t make sense to me. How is bro going to listen to every word Tim says, and not question it. It was kinda hard to listen to, getting side track about how apple this and that. Just say you don&#39;t like repairability, people respect a company more when they are honest.<br><br>- I don&#39;t think apple &quot;bought&quot; his channel that would be irrational, I think that MKBHD isn&#39;t well informed on how phones work. He&#39;s one of the biggest in the tech space, again he does REVIEWS mainly. So, why would he question a giant company like apple about anything? He assumes they are right and moves on, and I don&#39;t think he was throwing us under the bus intentionally at all."
Im sorry bro but you lived long enough to see yourself become the villain 😢
apple shill
How big was the check to sell out? Just curious for future positive reviews.
I guess next we can expect a glowing sit-down with Elon Musk about how the Cybertruck is the greatest vehicle ever
I literally unsubscribed after this.
Tim is cooked
OMG....
"Apple haters not welcome, not wanted here"
the part with magic mouse😂
Unsubscribed.<br>You sold your reputation to Apple.<br>Bye
iSheep🐑 talking with his iSheperd🤠
"Blatant lies. Apple is using you as a tool for mass manipulation and gaslighting. If you had no idea, you are not doing your job as a tech influencer.<br>If you are willfully partaking in this falsification/marketing campaign - ask yourself: &quot;what have I become?&quot; and repent.<br><br>You can still save face."
People complaining about propaganda and are helping with the view count. 🤣😂🤣
Sooooo booriiiinnnnggg
Sellout
shill
Propaganda
came here after louis rossman’s video and i’m disgusted. to misuse your platform like this is WILDLY irresponsible and hugely disappointing. definitely the final straw.
Steve Jobs Apple was innovative and genuinely intresting.<br><br>Tims Apple is just a money machine for investors.
Respond to Rossman.
"Dude, your nose is getting brown."
Lies lies and lies.
This is unexpected from MKBHD. He is now spreading misinformation and marketing propaganda  on his channel. This is really sad!
bought out by apple
jeez...I hope the money is worth it!
These people are so creepy; it&#39;s a shame that Marques is becoming more and more brand biased.
"Tech review YouTubers are just a bunch of sellouts, they squeeze the sh** out of their viewers with high price low quality garbage tech products."
"Shame, shame, shame! <b>ding ding</b> Shame, shame! <b>ding</b>"
"This was a test run for you. I hope the message from your followers is clear. Vocal minority be damned, but sadly they can be a highly influential."
Your mom died when you bought an iPhone.
PROPAGANDA. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. WHAT DID THEY PAY YOU?
Cool propaganda
Downfall must be studied. Bro got a bag for this
You are a pawn to Apple. They don&#39;t care
"Sold your soul for some clicks. Congrats, marques"
After watching this video I decided to unsubscribe from MKBHD. Hope many people are also doing the same.
Mark fell off hard
Welp it&#39;s been a good run MB<br><br>Time to unsubscribe
&#39;the magic mouse was about the ergonomics&#39; this clown destroyed his credibility right there
Well well well 😂
Louis made me unsub
shill
"I have watched you for a long time, I see now that Apple is your master. What a bunch of bull with repairability, Apple purposely puts roadblocks to not repair, to make you buy new. I am so disappointed with how biased you are with this, I hope Apple paid you well for you to compromise your integrity! How can I take anything as unbiased reviewing from you moving forward?"
I love how removing a charging cable from packaging is considered “green” but a removable battery isn’t.
sellout
- Luis Rossman has entered the chat with receipts in hand. 🧾
What happened my guy? You kinda fucked up on this one.
Louis Rossmann the man the legend !
This is worse than I thought it was going to be. Does anyone know who I could trust for reviews?
"Never trust a person that watches their words as closely as an Apple executive, and now, apparently, Marques."
lol its the apple shill marques brownlee.
"Eyyyyup. Right after rightfully sticking it to ai, you slurp up to apple. Shame, I was happy to see the ai dunking, but this is shameful."
"To do an interview with TC at Apple HQ was always going to be interesting. But look at what’s really happening here Apple which originally ignored utube press is now acknowledging them. Well done, Marques. I really enjoyed the video. Awesome 👏"
"Anyone else noticing the AI summary in YouTube shows mostly positive feedback, although top comments are all about how this is just Apple Propoganda 😂"
"Apple is full of lies, they have made so many design mistakes in the past that they continued to make for years while charging top dollar to repair their own mistakes and telling their customers they were wrong. <br><br>They are the worst thing to happen to the tech industry in terms of electronic longevity, durability, and independent repair. <br><br>They didn’t lock down parts and limit who had access to them so they can control the quality, they did it to make a profit at everyone’s expense. Apple business model includes repairs on known design issues that were frankly done intentionally. <br><br>New iPhone coming out soon, Watch your 2-5 year old phone start acting weird all of a sudden."
Very good infomercial 😂 scripted and bought out but well presented
"Hey @MKBHD, I just watched a video of Louis Rossman where he tears you to shreds, and rightfully so, for being a softball mouthpiece for Apple, instead of standing up for consumers. You&#39;ve lost my subscription. Shame on you for misusing your position and our trust. You just failed everything you stand for as an independent reviewer."
"Just so you know, Marques is no longer unbiased but a full blown shill for Apple... Oh and a shill for Tesla as well. If those weren&#39;t obvious to you."
Gotta make a response video to LR.
Propaganda garbage
"I’ve questioned Marques’ honestly before in reviews and it’s clear he’s a shill.  My small amount of views won’t hurt him, but I’ll do my part.  Last video I’ll ever watch from him."
"Nice propaganda, good &quot;research&quot;"
Sad that so many people believe such lies from Apple. How much did they pay you for this propaganda?
Disappointed in you dude...
Stop doing propaganda.
Paid propaganda - this channel is clearly no longer unbiased.
Gotta admire how each and every response of his was just corporate speak.
"Thanks for opening my eyes to the bad quality of apple devices, I think I’ll look elsewhere from now on."
2 total clowns having a conversation
Anyone can be bought.
Traitor to the people
Both of these fools are so full of it.
Why are people surprised? Western reviewers especially American reviewers lol.
Marques goes to the dark side. Nope. I&#39;m out.
you really became a corporate puppet helping Apple push propaganda. I will never trust your opinion again. How do you let him spew lie after lie to your face while you sit there and smile.
Propaganda at its finest
Listening to this instead of watching it. Which makes it feel like this is an interrogation on charge that is going to happen
"When will we hear “We at Apple&quot; from Marques, with praying hands? Simply god-given."
Apple makes their devices not reparable because reparable devices won&#39;t last? That&#39;s quite the spin.
"Apple is not about the &quot;forward&quot;, only about what will earn more money."
APPLE ARE AS DISHONEST AS ANY BIG TECH COMPANY. THEY ARE BLATANTLY ANTI-REPAIR DESPITE CLAMING OTHERWISE. MARQUES IS A SHILL.
Mkbhd needs to respond to this.
"Man, Louis Rossman went Super Saiyan 3 on this topic... Loved his video"
What the heck dude!!!! you were suppose to crush him with our (suffering customers&#39;) concerns and real issues with apple products. You know more than anyone how they take advantange of trusting customers and consumers! why didn&#39;t you ask any of those questions?! what happend to you? you were the tech person that a looot of people and youtubers looked up to you... I am really disappointed and sad that we lost another good person to the gready coorporations.
Thanks for the whole ad but not interested
even my isponsor block on my yt app detects the whole vid as an ad and skips until the end
bro fell off
top 10 anime betrayals
10 years of effort into waste
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=40"">0:40</a> Apple today finally admits it, that they have been using AI weapons to execute for years!"
bro finally got to talk with tim after getting sold out
Finally someone called out this apple shill
I&#39;d love to see a response to Louis Rossman.
This is so bad. I cant understand why so much people fall for this bullshit.
sell out &gt;:(
Lost my respect for you man...
more propaganda from Marques.  shame
I&#39;m here after Louis Rossmann video: wow and smh.
how about advocating right to repair to support independent repair shop
"Apple is pretty good at crushing things, including reputations."
how embarrassing marque$ brownNose
"Great propaganda, hope your f&#39;ing bag was worth it."
Why does he sound like he barely uses Apple products? Or is it just the way I am hearing it?
When a shill doesn&#39;t even pretend to be shill anymore. 😆
"Few things. I think Marques does not realize that the only intention why apple gives him such exclusive insights is to use his reach for their public standing. Especially under the current circumstances where the EU goes hard against such companies they will victimise themselves as the ooh so poor little company who just want to make the world better. The Tim Cook interview felt a bit like Marques wanted to be friendly and not criticise anything, which makes the interview while somewhat interesting, worthless and even harmful in some parts. Marques is not not a journalist, but a tech enthusiast and in this case apple used his reach for greenwashing and to appear as if they only have the customers interests in mind.<br>I think in the future Marques should either stick to reviewing tech or be alot more critical and „journalistic“ when been giving the opportunity, even if that means he wont get exclusive interviews anymore."
I like propaganda
So about Louis telling the truth
More Apple propaganda?
"They knew the interview/ad is so full of s**t that they included the joke about the magic mouse and ergonomics. Basic marketing strategy, use the more common but harmless critique you have against you and own it, that way you seem like you still have some self reflection while avoiding all the major issues"
Didn’t know Apple had a second channel.
Marques is an apple shill. Watch Louis Rossman and unsubscribe to these &quot;influencers&quot; that promote trash.
Lots of softball questions. How much is Apple paying you?
"Unsubscribed!  When Louis Rossmann callin u out, u messed up."
"How does it feel to be a tool? Asking for a friend, as he&#39;d like big tech to become his sugar daddy."
Propaganda!
"Everyone has a price, even MKBHD, such a shame. If he just even tried to make it less scripted and propagandish, but nooo lets go pedal to the metal propaganda"
I don&#39;t know why it took one guy to finally call out MKBHD for being a brand friendly tech tuber.<br><br>That&#39;s the reason i stopped watching him like 5 years ago. The dude is only critical toward smaller companies but if it&#39;s big tech like Apple or Microsoft and Google he&#39;ll be incredibly passive and as nice as possible.<br><br><br>Need proof? Just look at his video on youtube dislikes..
"Marques. You were able to build an audience because people thought you had integrity.  Participating in whats clearly propaganda stains what you built.  I, for one, can&#39;t take you serious anymore. What a bummer"
"used to love your videos. , can&#39;t trust u now.. thanks for this."
A lot of Gobley goop. I wouldn’t trust anything that guy says. Oh by the way I never got my new battery remember that or deal.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> The face of the man that knows he is never going to morally recover from this."
Two video previous to this video and two videos following this video is about Apple. Marques is losing his neutral stance quite quickly. About time you changed your channel&#39;s name to iMKBHD
"So even Tim couldn&#39;t figure out which iPhone model was in front of him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a>"
"Just came from the Louis Rossmann video.<br>Everyone is happy. Everything is good. Everything is fine in this interview.<br>I&#39;m 99,9% sure that Apple provided the skript and wrote in every small detail, like the caugh in the beginning."
"I don&#39;t blame you for selling out as long as you got paid right man. What&#39;s sad is that inevitably someone will buy an apple product because you did this interview. This propaganda will make people trust apple because they trust you. And you just lied to them making it seem like they can trust apple with their privacy or the longevity of the devices they purchase when the evidence is there that you should NEVER trust a billion dollar company with your data ESPECIALLY APPLE AND GOOGLE(because they profit from it) and theres multiple disgusting instances of leaks on apple devices that happened because people are forced to send their devices back to apple instead of being able to take it to a trusted repairman. Not mad,<br>Just dissapointed."
Mkbhd had a good run
"Why do you videos seem like commercials now???????? No matter the demographic, it seems like once you hit a certain level of success then the consumers suffer. Capitalism at its finest..."
MKBHD being an industry plant mouthpiece was NOT on my 2024 bingo
How long have you been on apples payroll?
Im proud of this comment section.
Straight from Tim&#39;s mouth saying Thank you for coming to MKBHD... Wow... That&#39;s humbling to hear from an Apple CEO.
Not enough shilling for one week?
Propaganda BS from someone who tries to say they are for the consumer
Do better.
From lambasting a car company for a shit car to sucking up to Tim Apple for their shit policies around their products. Feels bad man. This is the iDubbbz moment when he gave up on his fan base for a tart.
"I just unsubscribed, this one was just too much. Making a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=992"">16:32</a> Apple add.... makes me sad"
That&#39;s the longest Apple ad I&#39;ve ever seen.<br>What a bunch of crap
Kissing a...?
This is like listening to two Mormons talking about Jesus
"Really sad to see how much you turned into a corporate propaganda channel. I used to love the way you wouldn&#39;t glaze any company and just gave quality videos on different products, but the fame has gotten to your head."
SHILL
Guy is becoming a bootlicker day by day. So this is what corporate bootlicking looks like.
He has 19 million subscribers and only 3 million views. Does anybody else see the numbers?
"Dude got too big for his own good, and now he&#39;s a puppet for spreading corporate propaganda."
"I don&#39;t see anything here about it being a paid sponsorship, isnt that against youtubes TOS?"
I think the commemts on this video is about to be disabled
Sooo disappointed in MKBHD
i mean i always know you are a propaganda channel heh
"Remind me how the nude photos and videos got leaked from iPhone users again? Oh right, Apple leaked them.<br>&quot;we don&#39;t aim to be first, we aim to be the best&quot; - Company who has never made the best product or software since 2012."
Not even CCP does this level of Propaganda
Apple propaganda. Nice softball questions. He&#39;s quick to shit on AI devices (which he&#39;s not wrong for) but bring that sams energy and level of criticism to every brand.
Crazy to see how the comment section has changed after Rossman&#39;s video (which is actually a great video btw). I&#39;d love to see Marques&#39; response - maybe on WVFRM?
"MKBHD, you need an immediate response to Louis Rossmann&#39;s scathing rant about this. ASAP. Who can trust you anymore?"
"Marques simping for money. How much did they give you too talk shit, or you just wanted to be a tool?"
where is the interview about the durability?
Propaganda man
should be renamed to &quot;talking tech and scams with a scam-artist.&quot;
Welp...that&#39;s a new low 😐
A shill talks to his sugar daddy
Looks like you found the highest bidder for your integrity! Congrats on selling out.
crApple propaganda. pathetic.
Booooo
Channel turned Into apple propaganda.. Your sold your souls
seems like louis rossmann&#39;s single video made a huge toll on MKBHD&#39;s reputation
The Magic Mouse moment had me in tears. SO FAKE.
Apple shills liked this video.
What a propaganda.
should adone an interview with rossmann instead
ball gargling on full display
"Laughable 😅, You should run for president."
"marcus brownlee, proud supporter of foxconn &#39;worker jump prevention&#39; nets. anything for money, anything for access. oldest profession"
"Came after looking Samtime, JUST TO UNSUBSCRIBE for this let down channel."
"Anyone thinking all these Youtubers are not biased are the real fools. No matter how much they claim to be independent, non-biased, etc. the fact of matter is they are all bought by these corporations and their livelihood depends on them."
"What is this channel supposed to be? If it&#39;s clearly marked as a channel of advertisement, then no foul. If MKBHD is not telling himself or his viewers that he&#39;s a spokesman for sale, then there&#39;s something that really needs to be addressed before continuing to make videos"
"Real talk, this individual does not have your interest in mind. Apple is just for propaganda. The set that ran off with it aren&#39;t the ones who actually build the product up to par so when you buy that product keep in mind that it&#39;s not what you&#39;re looking for and it&#39;s not from the original creator. Not jobs jobs was in the office your governor&#39;s Southwest or whatever it is by bridge Street and Madison Alabama on steeplechase by the 600 numbers which have been changed out."
What a  way to loose credibility in just an infomercial for apple 😮
"still trying to get the paid propagandist stink off of you, eh?"
Apple Propaganda
Its not propaganda by Marques Brownlee Tim Cook just wasnt critical about appel procts
I feel like I just watched two AI bots talking about AI for 16min straight
Hmmmm i like coolaid...😅
apple fanboys will do anything to cover up apple.
LouisRossma
Apple Propaganda like Just like iJustine lmao. I love it!
"MKBHD started his channel when he was a kid and started building it up from the ground to be a sellout, a corporation lapdog that will do anything for money, in the end, everything is about the money, what a shame, this channel could be an independent creator with some dignity."
Shame on MKBHD for facilitating ads like this. Now I wonder if everything this guy posts is a lie. At least this one is.
"Louis Rossman aside, this is just a really boring interview. It simply HAS to be scripted."
MKBHD is a joke
cut the BS
"Great interview, all it cost was his integrity."
Louis Rossman&#39;s video needs to be answered. Sad to see this BS.
This is trash. I got about halfway through and ran out of memory. I only had 8gb to start and it&#39;s not upgradable.
"En resumen de esta publicidad, el Iphone sigue siendo el invento mas disruptivo de la historia. Y Apple promete mantener buena conducta y confidencialidad de tus datos con al llegada de la IA."
"This was not very cash money of you mkbhd. You know what you&#39;re doing, do better"
This feels like what the fake interview with Kim Jong Il was supposed to be
I wonder why Tim doesnt admit that the ergonomics of the magic mouse is most definitely not well done.
I feel dirty after watching this.
You really gave all that was left of your integrity away by doing this Marques. And to think I used to recommend you to people who need advice on what tech to buy. I hope the money was worth it. 😞
Whenever MKBHD talks Apple just know it’s an advertisement even if he doesn’t say so.
"The production quality of your videos is absolutely great. However, content is equally important. I&#39;ve enjoyed watching your videos for a long time, but it&#39;s disappointing to see the channel&#39;s perspective pivot from reporting facts with grounded opinions to brand-safe marketing. This is not just based on this video, but the past few videos of yours where the focus appears to be on marketing for Apple rather than honest criticism.<br><br>This is an unsubscribe from me for now."
MKBHD is the tech world&#39;s answer to what Joseph Goebbels was for the Nazi party.  Only Goebbels believed in the politics (how ever wrong and sick that is.) MKBHD is only doing it for money and power (Influence).
"Following this shill video, waiting for MKBHD&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m Sorry, please trust me 19.1M subs!&quot; video, ala Linus Tech Tips"
Louis Rossman vs Apple beef will surmount Kenrick vs Drake. MKBHD take notes from j cole
What bs hype.   Why do people still watch this channel?  I was sent the link to see how bad this is.  Well he has fallen as far as gaming journalists.   Just shilling for clicks.
Should be called &quot;Shilling for Apple&quot; - what a waste of space you&#39;ve become
The fact that he is dogin all rossman comments shows how fake mkhd is. Sorry to see a grate tech channel fall from grace just to protect Apple
"Marques you should have gone to the interview with your Samsung galaxy 24,,,,<br>I’m kidding, man. I love you."
And there goes the last remaining piece of Marques&#39; spine. What a shame.
hi from wilsacom
"Honestly, what a useless and pandering interview. Uninteresting at best, more Apple propoganda at worst"
hideous propaganda video. it&#39;s hell to rely on apple products for making a living. the only actual solution is workplace democratization and then some more! i hope everyone hears what Louis Rossman has to say about this.
Why did you do this Marques? Louis Rossman is completely right and you just let us down man.
"I believe there are many things that people won&#39;t understand unless they&#39;re put right in his position. Tim Cook respects him, and I think that&#39;s why he agreed to the interview, so as the CEO of the world&#39;s leading technology company, he also deserves to be respected. People are simply demanding too much."
"Amidst a series of already famous products, and especially in the context of Apple recently launching a slew of potentially revolutionary products/features, asking about the Apple Magic Mouse, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a>, is certainly something that Tim Cook wouldn&#39;t have anticipated in the first place and would, of course, find surprising. His hesitation there was totally understandable. It’s pretty much like putting him on the spot. But many people here still seem unsatisfied. Perhaps what you guys want is for MKBHD to openly criticize Tim &amp; Apple products the way he did with Humane AI Pin, don&#39;t you?"
Nice marketing video you just forgot to add the sponsored by at the end...
Sellout
Apparently being the biggest tech youtuber doesn&#39;t require a single backbone
"Disgustingly biased video. Nothing in here is a talk, it&#39;s pure scripted propaganda. Highly disappointed in the quality of your videos"
"I&#39;m torn because I like MKBHD content. I like the direction Apple is taking, RCS, USB C, more options in iOS but most of them are directed by EU regulations. But this is sort of a propaganda piece. Saying that Apple has done things for repairability, for privacy, for the planet etc is bullshit. It&#39;s easy to not mention all the scandals like the private nude video stollen and uploaded by apple employees from somebody&#39;s broke phone. The obvious hardware flaws not covered by warranty and apple employees gaslighting the consumer, then the next phone that doesn&#39;t even correct the issue. The obvious steps to make the product prettier but performing worth or injuring its durability (glue in macbook exhaust). The dustgate... The list goes on, from year to year, product to product. All while not enabling independent repair shops access to Apple parts. Apple care more about forcing the consumer to buy another product than his ability to repair it."
Never noticed before but he has many of the same mannerisms and gestures as Steve jobs. Bit weird.
Cringe.
Please ask him to revert back the 3.5mm Jack Feature please 🙏
Marques please bro respond to Louis video. Apologize for shilling apple to us. This ain’t you.
"This show, just promotes Apple on a weekly basis, just add up how many had featured them."
Apple Longevity? That&#39;s a lie.
Shameful puff piece. Apple does not care about repairability or longevity.
Mkbhd got offered a break from picking cotton if he made this propaganda of a video.
Louis Rossmann cooked you
PLEASE RESPOND TO LOUIS ROSSMANS CRITIQUE OF YOUR APPLE INTERVIEW
Im waiting for marcus to reply to rossmann calling him and apples rubbish out😂
You lost it Mark. This is terrible.
brother you keep talking facts about Ipads having useless power. Why you did not ask Tim about it? I believe most of your followers would want to know if Apple have any plans to make Ipads better or just more powerful for no reason
shill
mkBSDick
Did Tim enjoy your hawk tua?
I have never seen a more boring interview than this
Where&#39;s the interview?
MKBHD is now owned by Apple. So sad
MKBHD...now is the time to get over this paid shill.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=120"">2:00</a> &quot;we are branding it&quot; like he works for apple, or does he?"
Sellout
imagine having zero backbone like marques
Propaganda 💯
Nice Propaganda Markass
Oh another Apple propaganda video
Garbage interview
Marques is a big enough channel he could have asked tough questions or could have asked if he could have asked them and if they refused then you could say Apple turned down the interview based on those questions.
propagandist
"Nice propaganda video MKBHD, way to go pants down. UNSUBCRIBING FROM THIS CHANNEL AS OF TODAY."
"This is pathetic to look at, now mkbhd has corporate blood of the brainwashed apple fans on his hands, lost my respect"
"My god, how low can you go?"
❤
"this MKBHD dude is everything thats wrong with journalism today. No research,  very shallow and propaganda like questions"
"Tim claims apple created software development with the app store, holy hell that is one of the stupidest takes on the planet. Thank you for creating C apple ?????"
"hold up the magic mouse is 4/5? someone get this man a steelseries arctis 3 from 10 years ago, it will absolutely blow his mind."
"It will be good, profitable relationship 😂"
Get Cook&#39;ed lol
Imagine being a sellout for Apple
Tim &quot; I will tell you what to ask me&quot; Cook screams fakery and BullSH#@ when his lips move LOL
bro did NOT rank those things
"Tim Apple, landfill busting<br>user replaceable iPhone battery when?<br>user replaceable iPad battery when?<br>user replaceable MacBook battery when?<br>wired keyboard when?<br>user replaceable mouse battery when?<br>user expandable Macintosh memory when?<br>Louis Rossmann says hi."
You should be ashamed of yourself Marques!
Nice propaganda
Totally Biased and just marketing.<br> MKBHD is sponsored by Apple.<br>Shame
did i just hear tim call the magic mouse &quot;ergonomic&quot;
"I hope he understands he is being used, or at least got paid generously for this..."
"MKBHD is not a tech youtuber anymore, he&#39;s a walking Billboard."
Disgusting
Didn’t think you could make a bad video. I didn’t want to be proven wrong.
"You can&#39;t call yourself a good tech youtuber without knowing that the words &quot;durability,&quot; &quot;repairability,&quot; &quot;longevity&quot;and &quot;Apple&quot; don&#39;t fit in the same sentence."
Just Propaganda
Damn he just was called out
Am I the only person who doesn’t use screen time ?
"sweet, anti-consumer propaganda"
Another apple propaganda promoted
"All you have to know about apple is that it takes a law suit for them to acknowledge mistake and do customer service. Longevity through not caring:<br><br>Apple last year agreed to pay $35 million to settle a U.S. class action lawsuit alleging that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were prone to audio issues due to a defective chip in the devices, and it has now started notifying eligible customers by email.<br><br>In an internal document, obtained by MacRumors in May 2018, Apple acknowledged a microphone issue affecting some iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models:<br><br>Some customers might report that after they&#39;ve updated to iOS 11.3, the microphone on their iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus doesn&#39;t work and the speaker button is grayed out when they make or receive a call.<br><br>The alleged defect is informally known as &quot;Loop Disease&quot; online. Despite acknowledging the issue internally, Apple never posted a service program about the issue on its website, and it never responded to our repeated requests for comment."
"Get Tims apples out of your mouth and treat them how they deserve, like that worst review video. MKBHD afraid to punch up, he just bows down."
"Louis rossman video sent me here, please try and stay impartial bro, it looks bad on you and it&#39;s sad because u make good content"
Louis Rossman said it perfectly nothing but Propaganda SUPPORT RIGHT TO REPAIR !!
Propaganda boy
Propaganda
Apple propaganda.
"“Congratulations, you are now my EliTe EmplOYeE”"
"Wow, what a great piece of corporate propaganda. I’ve never unsubbed faster from a channel… Shame on you MK(Brown-nose)HD"
Lol louis rosmann destroyed MK about apple longevity.
Tim Cook is very laid back and very chill regardless of the highly stressful job that he has
"This is a cringe video, Apple propaganda"
I’m here from Louis Rossman’s excellent video to happily give you engagement for the algorithm to tell you that I do not trust you any more.  Only a fool would after this.
"Tim Apple&#39;s voice is so soothing, put me to sleep 3 separate times. Definitely need him to record some bedtime story audiobooks"
"Remember, tech youtubers are NEVER real journalists. When they do interviews with tech company CEOs, I don&#39;t think they are ever gonna talk about the flaws or inperfections in their products--otherwise the interviews wouldn&#39;t be possible in the first place. Louis Rossman called out the hypocrosy present in this interview very well. In these interviews, the power balance always tips towards tech companies, and what might follow from that simple observation is self-telling."
"Hi MKBHD. You crash the fisker car for bad engineering, but you praise Apple for repairability? My trust in you is lost.."
Came here to leave a dislike and flag this for misinformation. When did you become a shill?
"Oh yeah, keep the appleganda coming, that&#39;s my jam"
Check out Louis Rossman&#39;s debunking of Apple&#39;s bogus claims about &quot;longevity&quot; of their products.
Rossmann just owned you. You&#39;re a shill to the highest degree!
"when you only ask the questions the interviewee wants to answer, then is not a real inetrview, it&#39;s an ad"
Rossmann FTW. At least we all get to see MKBHDs true colours now.
The shills are alive with the sound of Apple
Please respond to Louis Rossmann....
Why is he simping instead of asking real questions? Seems like there are alot of lies to be uncovered here...😅
"Pretty sad propaganda, I&#39;m never going to watch you again, but I hope that boot tastes good."
"money is the motive, shame brother, shame. common Louis Rossmann W"
This is honestly embarassing from you Marques. Someone who has been reviewing smart phones and tech for so long and you just take every lie Tim says at face value. Just completely embarassing
And the propaganda continues
Apple is a scum company
Louis Rossmann 1 Apple shills 0
I guess when you act as a corporate mouthpiece for them then the CEO is happy to talk to you. <br><br>Apple shill.
Apple sucks and MKBHD is just a fanboi.  He has enough money to buy whatever Apple trash again and not care where normal people pay $1.5K for a phone and it breaks on them in stupid ways while Apple tells them to pound sand.  Louis Rossman lit you on fire.  Hope Apple paid you enough for advertisement and selling out.
"Very weird people want to shit on Tim for the magic mouse shit but not, I don&#39;t know, literally any other negative aspect of Apple."
"Crazy Propaganda, never thought MKBHD and the third reich would have so much in common 😮"
"Love how you didn&#39;t ask any useful questions, just easy ones so you don&#39;t lose out on getting iPhones sent to you.<br><br>Shame on your Marques. You&#39;re a disgrace to reviewers.<br><br>Go watch Louis Rossmann if you want the actual issues with Apple."
What an amazing video! Modern day propaganda is so interesting to witness
This guy has lost all credibility amongst the consumers. I remember mkbhd when he cared about the consumers watch louis Rossmans video he explains all the reasons why this guy is a paid influencer for corporations.
SELLOUTT
This is fucking propoganda not an interview
Louis Rossman has notes
BS
"You are now part of the problem. I thought you were unbiased MKBHD, but you are a disgrace"
Im sorry marques but I can no longer support you as a viewer I know that this means absolutely nothing to you but I just wanna say I really did enjoy your channel and I hope that you will change going forward money corrupts
Nice corporate shilling.
Well. You just burned up a lot of respect with these videos. I&#39;m not recommending you any more. Won&#39;t mean much to you. But I won&#39;t be the only one. Enjoy the money.
"I love you marquees, but this is really just some propaganda for a shit company. It would be amazing with you talked to Louis about it."
"Why would you do this, who made you this way."
Just call him daddy and be done with it
"please look at your dislikes and really think about why you have almost 7k dislikes. some of those will be your apple haters, sure. <br>but this interview has me wondering if you need some knee pads..."
i tried watching this but my adblocker didnt let me
Garbage biased interview
You can do better than sucking up to Apple!
Great softball interview. Why not just do a commercial for them?
MKBHD needs to STOP Cappin 4 APPLE. Its SAD
WARNING: the following video is bullshit Apple Propaganda containing NOTHING BUT LIES
"Came from louissrossman, what a fucking propaganda piece"
"I am glad that Louis is calling you out on your BS. You have become a joke of yourself. I hope more people see the truth and come the same conclusion: ignore, unfollow and help others to do the same."
"Tbh, I didn&#39;t even watch this video after I saw a clip of Tim talking about the Magic Mouse... but man, after seeing Louis Rossman&#39;s video, this is bad. We really don&#39;t need 20 minute Apple ads. If you&#39;re not gonna ask hard questions AND enforce that he answers them or gets called out on it (or lies)... then we don&#39;t need this interview. I knew you were &quot;brand safe,&quot; I don&#39;t expect a CIA interrogation, but this is bad even for your standards."
"Ahhh, it’s nice when employees get to meet the big boss ☺️"
"Softball, baseball who gives a ..... Mkbhd loves golf lol should have expected this"
"my comment got deleted, because I told the truth"
marques: let&#39;s make a blind ranking of your products<br>tim: no i&#39;m not gonna rank any of them
Pure apple propaganda
why did you disable the dislike marques XD
Batter up! In this episode Marques plays softball!
Marques has no integrity.
Propaganda. Thank you!
"MKBHD lol, why not call out time for selling overpriced products with minimal repairability ?"
Is there any reason beyond horizontal scroll to use a magic mouse?
If I&#39;m gonna watch softball I prefer it to be college women&#39;s. Fuck apple
"If the toughest question you have for Tim Cook is about the ergonomics of the magic mouse, that was the single question they let you ask to pretend not to be a softball.<br><br>How about asking them about the class action lawsuits, where they knew they had designed their iPhone 6 to bend the motherboard and break internally, and the iPhone 7 had the exact same issue, and in all cases, as always, they refused to warranty any of it, until they lost class action lawsuits and had to.<br><br>Glue didnt solve motherboard deflection. It just made repair much harder, with no benefit to anyone."
"Are they going to stop screwing their custoner with badly designed products, shitty emloyees and zero warranty?"
Haven’t liked mkbhd ever honestly always thought he was an apple shill and a Tesla shill
Classic access journalism mkbhd...
PROPAGANDA
This whole video is a bit of a yikes apple is really going hard on the bandaid
You need to stop the propaganda train. How about you stop being greedy and reckless?
Guess times are tough even the rich shills are becoming paid mouths
Wait &quot;ergonomics&quot; and apple magic mouse? Is he from alternative universe or something?
"What a shill, apple is the worst to repair out of all brands i work on. Screen hinge sensor with proprietary software??? Bending circuitboard that fractures the solder points?"
best apple commercial yet.
"Apple, the monopoly MKBHD will always defend regardless."
Propaganda
"Mkbhd has officially sold out to Apple, it&#39;s sad. Used to be a big fan but I can&#39;t trust your apple biased opinions. I know losing me as a subscriber won&#39;t matter but to all of you others out there, beware when influncers get way too close to what they review..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> - &quot;ergonomics&quot;? please what?"
Lol this is a joke right?
Rare that the boss takes some time to talk to his employees.
Inb4 the next &quot;HHAHAHAHAH TIM COOK MAKE FACE WHEN MAGIC MOUSE!!1!!!&quot; 😂😂😂. Yall are actually so unoriginal and unfunny its insane. Ive never seen this much vanilla in a comment section.
Paid propoganda.
"I&#39;m a big fan of you. but please, try to do a proper interview instead of being a point of a fan boy view next time."
My boy answered nothing. &quot;Don&#39;t look to the past&quot; - recycles iphone4 and 5 design
I had doubts but now it finally became absolutely clear that over years M became a spineless mouth of propaganda for corporations.
The apple sellout
This looks like something I&#39;d see on Linkedin not YouTube. It&#39;s just marketing.
"Influencer that don&#39;t care to be paid advertisement for companies without any vetting are hurting us all . They destroy all the good work Louis Rossman and others like him do for us, in calling out this big corporations that don&#39;t care about consumers and use shady practices to hurt us, and influence laws that go against consumers interests. <br>Shame on this dude, this is lazy, this is careless, this is shady, this is disgraceful."
Baaaaaaa 🐑. Lost all respect for MKBHD.
"Alright, I don&#39;t really want to support a propaganda channel for one of the most insidious companies out there: Getting rid of the headphone jack, singlehandedly responsible for the fragmentation of ubiquitous non-proprietary charging and data transfer standards (sticking to lightening over USB), not to mention their crusade against right-to-repair. Goodbye MKBHD. We had a good run! :)"
Louis call you out… 😂
MKBHD is a total sellout
Come the fuck on dude. Look at how much this company charges for MAC wheels alone. Apple is garbage for NPCs
Asking no hardball questions.... Are you even impartial anymore? I love my iPhone but you must hold them accountable and not be gaslit by their &quot;we prefer a design that doesn&#39;t break&quot;... NO YOU SHOULD HAVE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE MARQUES! You can have your design WITH repairability... You truly are an influencer for company propaganda 😮‍💨
So scripted
"MKBHD: i would never shill for any tech company because i keep the consumers in mind! ................unless they are a mega corp that can pay my mega corp shill fee, then the consumer can eat shit because I&#39;m getting FUCKING PAAAAAAID!"
Any comment on  Louis Rossmanns video? What @MarquesBrownlee tim got your tongue?
This is Apple propaganda
"This is disingenuous, fluffed, and harmful to consumers. Absolutely glazing apple for the under the table sponsor money. This shouldnt be the job of a coddled, morally compromised tech review influencer and you know it, but it benefits you and Apple way too much to not lie to your fans anyways."
"what a riveting SCRIPTED conversation.  Louis Rossman was right.  This wasn&#39;t softball, it was Tee Ball level of questioning.  Marquez, how much stock did you get for this interview?"
Jack Barker from Silicon Valery
This is pure propaganda
What absolute horseshit propaganda. Marques has lost all journalistic integrity.
Sellout😊
This is disgusting propaganda and I’ll never take anything Marques says seriously again
Wtf man.... You could have actually asked the tough questions. Idk... Just disappointed.
I hope the check was fat enough to make up for the credibility lost from this propaganda.
"Louissrossman calls MKBHD out perfectly, Apple doesn&#39;t like repair"
Literal apple propaganda video. Such a shame...
lets talk about nothing
Your content is just crappy propaganda
Apple propaganda gaslighting = UNSUBSCRIBE
"Apple propaganda channel, sad"
Sad dude. Truly sad.
Apple shilling to the max. Louis Rossmann just owned your arse. You are NOT a journalist.
Ahh yes the corporate slaver meeting his overlord 🤡
"Sell out. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>"
What an apple shill this channel has become
"What a softball PR stunt. MKBHD and Apple are perfect bedfellows; just as Apple is all about form over function, Marques is all style over substance. . ."
Here after watching Louis Rossmann’s video. <br>Pretty bad :(
Came after the Louis Rossman video to see the Apple shill himself at work.
MKBHD....I&#39;ve been a long time subscriber... I have my doubts....
"Damn this guy always telling people he doesn&#39;t accept payments for catering to manufacturers, and then does this suck up interview with Apple."
In 2027 replaceable battery are gonna be mandatory in Europe <br>I&#39;ll wait till then to change my phone <br>That&#39;s actually a green move
A tech influencer helping Apple spread their propaganda.<br>Pathetic.
"They sure did pay you a lot for three videos in a row, glad Rossman is uncovering everything this shady company does, included your bootlicking propaganda"
Enjoy the Apple Kool Aid!!
So glad you can sell your soul to the trillion $ company
anyone watching this after Rossmann&#39;s vid? wanted to see how much I&#39;ll hurl.
Feels more like marketing propaganda than an interview
Paid Sponsorship ?
how much were you paid to run this propoganda?
Shilling for Aple and battery car garbage.
Marques is not being allowed back to talk to Tim after the Magic Mouse Question
"Uncovering Every Lie in MKBHD&#39;s Softball Interview; a scathing critique of &#39;brand safe&#39; influencers 😁😁😆😆😂😂😂😂😆😆😁😁 <br>Louis Rossmann, my man!"
This is so scripted it&#39;s just sad...
"This video is a disservice, geez"
lol. I heard about Marquis of MKBITCH sold himself out . So I came over and saw. Yup!
Apple propaganda channel
Tim Apple looks exactly like that stupid Magic Mouse they have.
terrible just terrible marques
propaganda
Puppet
More garbage apple propaganda. Stop platforming their trash bullshit MKBHD.
I can tell he was sweating on the inside when the magic mouse came in.
He didnt give numbers for the rankings! I call shenanigans!<br><br>Neener neener hes a cheater! 😁
"I noticed on MKBHD&#39;s iPhone that the interview ended at exactly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=213"">3:33</a>. 🙏"
With the Magic Mouse?..mkay
"Is it me or is there something really wrong with Apple&#39;s focus mode? Sometimes, when you&#39;re in the focus, it allows some phone call notifications. Why is it that way, Marques? Any thoughts?"
I love how you&#39;re now a champion of the brand of white privilege!
Why you didn&#39;t talk about the Mouse if it was on your mind bro!. At least we would have known that what they thought about the charging port. Also you could have been the one because of which Magic Mouse would have been ReBorn!
"My iPhone XR, wife’s 11 pro and brother in laws iPhone 11 Pro Max is OVERHEATING since we updated to iOS 17.5.1. Batteries are draining quicker too. Guess apple are still up to their tricks."
😁
"I would like to ask a question to Tim. Why The back of the ipad pro m4 has a vertical logo, while the back of the magic keyboad is horizontal,      And if you designed it to have the camera in landscape orientation and to allow users to play on the iPad in landscape orientation, why change the logo to landscape orientation? It doesn&#39;t look right when I take pictures, and I&#39;ve seen it many times,Thanks you."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=145"">2:25</a> sure sure"
The fact that Tim went from being CEO of Apple to Interviewing THE MKBHD is amazing. So proud of him I hope he makes it big one day.
"Been watching Marques for a LONG time, so happy to see how far he’s come. Now he has 2 amazingly insightful interviews under his belt, Elon and Tim, massive congratulations my man. I know this is just the beginning…"
"as soon as he said magic mouse the guy in the control room  &quot;zoom in on marques now please&quot; I think tim was trolling him, if marques cracked Tim was gunna be like &quot;got em!! &quot;"
"Tim: Magic mouse moment was great and its ergonomics was alsos great.<br><br>MKBHD: Face down, disappointed. Should I leave YouTube 😂"
We can clearly see on Marques face— hiw easily he caught Tim&#39;s white lie about Magic Mouse and Ergonomics. 😂😂😂😂
I’ll never understand why anyone cares how much time someone else spends on their device. Why is it even a conversation?
Why didn&#39;t he rank the products
Very fake. Just like any other ceo.
"If anything, it shows how far Tim has came to be sitting in front of the man the myth the MKfuckinBHD now."
Plzz try to get some leaks on iphone 16 eagerly waiting for the launch
"I call bs, this old timmer is just yapping w/e. Dead parents into vision pro lmao"
I was wondering does the chat gpt enhance the performance of SIRI ?  and with ios 18 updates Apple intelegence it ?
I even don&#39;t know what a magic mouse is 😂
"Marques, why iPhone instead your favorite Samsung Galaxy?"
Really disappointed to not have a real ranking from him haha
"Dear MKBHD, please review a Lava phone 😁😁"
Smart man.
"(En)<br>June 25 2024 Tuesday<br>Dear Mr. Tim Cook<br>This is Louis, a big fan of yours, <br>I have a suggestion about mac book, make a mac book with no screen, only the keyboard part, sell the screen with different sizes separately, so that a mac user can choose different sizes of screen they wanted anytime, go out with 13, 14 inches,  at home 24, 32 inches display, so that can be more flexible and make more profit by selling more screens, consumers love it for sure cause at home or office can have a larger display to see more clearly and more details."
He knew what he was doing by throwing the Magic Mouse in there lmaoo
I just loved Marques’ clarification
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a>"
tim cook talks like he&#39;s struggling
Why do I feel like he didn&#39;t give any clear or meaningful answers to any of the questions asked? 🤔
"He sounds identical to Bill Gates, in the way he speaks, the tonality of his voice, speed, etc."
Bro Tim is not cooking 💀
Tim fatheerrr 😅
"YOOOoooo!!! The intro beat was/ is amazing, but it&#39;s too  short!  Where can I hear a longer mix please?!"
blabla.. in EU nothing with AI comes on Apple . So I go back to Windows on Arm Devices
"&quot;I mean for us, we&#39;ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices...&quot; – wait what?🤣"
Close call on the phone. 🙃
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=346"">05:46</a>- he is talking about the real magic 🔥"
Tim got cooked with the magic mouse question. 😭😭
The editing with the shots on Marques&#39; face when hearing Tim talking about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse is brilliant. 😂
"&quot;we view privacy as a fundamental human right&quot;<br>say tim cook who was PAID to keep contacts app open to all apps - it&#39;s still open, until the next iOS version. a decade of harming users."
interview with the guy who destroyed apple
Useless video 4 sure. Please don&#39;t waste your time too marques next time on such a diplomatic person
It&#39;s sad how such an expensive device can loose signal when covered with a tin foil😭😭. I just lost my 15 pro max and can&#39;t be found even when using find my. I&#39;m defeated shem😢
Bro when he clarified cook talking about ergonomics with “magic mouse” I almost died 😂 I have one and it’s so bad
"Don’t call me a hater, but I hate him cook. He has so much money, but he still greedy."
CEO of talking a lot but saying nothing
"As a lifelong Apple fan and shareholder having had iPods with spinning wheels and the first iPhone and everything in between, I find the Vision Pro to be absolutely worthless."
I don’t care AT ALL about anything Tim has to say unless it has something to do with innovation
Apple is anti-repair and and anti-green. I&#39;ll never buy anything Apple again.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> reminds me of  “In the beningning ”😂😂😂"
"Exactly Tim enjoy interview with some that actually know and cares about people, i wouldn&#39;t  never waste my time talking to you about your shiny overpriced trend. Saveing the planet Tim???😂😂😂😂😂 lmfao"
I feel like tim cook is just used this interview to make 16 mins ad
Tim sucks at blind ranking. But he’s a CEO so he has to give CEO responses instead of answers 🤖
good morning!!!
"They should never have gotten rid of the iphone Mini... The larger the screen, the more addictive!! I am sure if Steve Jobs was alive he would still want a smaller iphone and lots of markets it does better; younger people, certain countries like Japan, etc, etc"
When will Apple feature a folding phone?  Its time!
I&#39;ve been trying ios 18 for a week and there&#39;s nothing to say wow .. it&#39;s two chokes added to the system which then also works very badly .. the battery sucked in a few hours .. it heats up so much that it always stops charging for the high temperature the widgets have improved some and others worse now you can&#39;t do the widget collection .. I&#39;m going to install in 2025 ios 18 now it really sucks
"1.) Iphone<br>2.) Ipad<br>3.) Macbook Air<br>4.) Vision Pro<br>5.) Magic Mouse (should not be on this list, tbh. I will never buy one.)"
"Going from zero to interviewing Tim Cook, Human Zuck, Sundar Pichai, Satlya Nadella, Space Jesus, Bill Gates is quite a career."
Tim Annan
Marques&#39;s expression when Tim was talking about the &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; is hilarious..😂😂
What is that annoying background sound through out the whole video?
y u not bring ur Pixel phone to show him!
"Wish you were more critical during interviews like these. During reviews and such you oftentimes have a different tone than while interviewing Cook or Federighi back then where you’re more nodding than being the impartial, critical reviewer you’ve established yourself to be. Like the Magic Mouse moment where you’re just saying “yeah” to whatever bs Cook said. Behind the curtain however (aka in reviews talking directly to your community) you’re saying much more than just “yeah”. Sad"
disaster answers
Tim’s mastered the way of saying a lot but nothing at this same time
"If Marques hadn&#39;t had his massive following and sway over the Apple community, Tim Cook wouldn&#39;t have given him the time of day. Or Marques had to pay for that interview. Conveniently, Marques didn&#39;t bother asking about patent infringements or the never-ending battery issues. Like Jobs before him, Cook cares more about money than technology. &quot;Privacy is a fundamental human right,&quot; he claims, yet their app store is a goldmine of user data, and you have to opt-out manually to protect yourself.<br>I&#39;m writing to let you know that your data is being exploited if you don&#39;t take action. &quot;We want to give you tools to do things you couldn&#39;t do otherwise,&quot; says Cook. But what were people doing before these so-called tools, Tim? All you&#39;re doing is feeding smartphone addiction, making people more distracted and lazy. How&#39;s that for a &quot;tool&quot;? Tim Cook is the tool!!!"

quite a knowledgeable lesbian if u ask me...
Ergonomic magic mouse🤣🤣🤣<br>Gtfo of here tim apple
"TROPICAL SWEETS STOOL SOFTENER FOR TIM COOK SAMPLES SOUND BYTES. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcIfY57lBJXp6AKBx4CoCA""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=331"">5:31</a> Even Tim got confused about which model iPhone it is!🤣"
Let&#39;s be fair - the magic mouse is pretty ergonomic... compared to the hockey puck mouse that came with the iMac 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a> “getting the ergonomics well done was key”-Tim “…With the Magic Mouse.” -Marques 😂😂😂😂"
THE FREE AND COMPULSORY U2 ALBUM CHANGED THE WORLD
THE ISIGHT CAMERA CHANGED THE WORLD
THE MAGIC MOUSE WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> Tim eating that good stuff saying the magic mouse is ergonomic 💀 the zoom into the facial expression 😂"
He remind me of unseasoned chicken.
Does anyone else love how Tim sounds like Benoit Blanc and Katherine Hepburn simultaneously? 😂
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> Tim is talking about ergonomics re movement; its a world class mouse in terms of interactive gestures (just less so in terms of charging design)"
"im not a complete apple shill, but it is interesting to watch an interview with the ceo of the 2nd most valuable company in the world"
Tim got me emotional in the end!
"Hi Marques,<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been an avid follower of your channel for years, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate the depth and clarity you bring to tech reviews. Your insights have truly fueled my passion for technology and have been my go-to source for staying updated.<br><br>I’m reaching out because I’m absolutely obsessed with the OnePlus 12. From your review, it seems like a game-changer, and I can&#39;t stop thinking about how it would enhance my daily life. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation, I&#39;m unable to afford it.<br><br>I know this is a big ask, but if there’s any chance you could consider gifting me a OnePlus 12, it would mean the world to me. It’s not just about having the latest tech; it’s about being able to experience and engage with something I’m deeply passionate about, thanks to your influence.<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and for all the amazing content you continue to create. Regardless of your decision, I’ll always be a dedicated fan.<br><br>Mukhtar"
"Marquess should be interviewing Craig Federighi, the CTO of Apple."
Let Tim cook
Or…so glad MKBHD got the opportunity to talk to Tim Cook (Apple CEO) 😉
Can&#39;t help laughing when they talked about Magic Mouse 😂
Can’t see if someone already asked for Tim Cook’s wore Nike shoes model. Anyone? 😅
Bro he def lying about vision pro 😂
"I was expecting some strong questions, so far it felt mkb was just being soft."
Last year MKBHD asked about the iPad calculator and now we have one. Maybe next year Apple will make a mouse.
Not an honest review
U can really tell he’s getting too old for these kind of interviews. <br><br>I hope we can see a younger more in touch CEO or market relations that understands the features more in-depth then just this surface level crap he’s spouting. <br><br>He’s definently not entirely lost but there glimpses everytime he answers a question how marques is just so fluid and natural with his thoughts. <br><br>Tim is more rigid and timid as to what to say and how to say it.
"&quot;The Apple Magic Mouse should feature compatibility with MagSafe technology for convenient charging, enhancing its user experience. Additionally, improvements in ergonomics would make the device more comfortable and intuitive to use for extended periods.&quot; - A sane human"
This is insane man. You’ve come such a long way!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> &quot;Our objective is never to be first. Our objetctive is to be best.&quot; DAMN"
Why is he shaking so much? Age or nervousness?
Why does this not have 10 million+ views
NEVER has the time savings benefits of technology NOT led to everyone being expected to simply do MORE.  So there isn’t a time savings benefit in the end.  We just do more and more in the time we have.  BECAUSE everyone ends up with the same advantage.
This is what happens when a CFO speaks about ideas and concepts. Does anyone saved a hair of Steve Jobs? maybe we can still bring him back.
That was not helpful. Tim gave general answers and i’m now more skeptical to the privacy of Apple and how that’s going to be used. So Tim your interview 1/5
@mkbhd - when are you going to review Sony Xperia 1 VI?
tim cook sounds like mr garrison.
Hey your videos are so great! Can you do an iPhone 16 pro rumors videos?
Tim Cook is a crook.
I’m so sick of Apple. Once my device craps out I’m not buying Apple any more.
We wanted to change like as ios6 to ios7 it&#39;s really the bigest changing of ios that  people need.
When he asked about the magic mouse I spat
"I wish Apple would add more arrhythmia detections to the Apple Watch, there&#39;s so many different types of arrhythmia that this things could detect"
What a horrible interviewer damn
"Hey Marquees, how many likes on youtube for you to send me apple products?"
The Apple store will be opened in Malaysia on June 22!🎉🎉
MacBook Air:	Tim reflects<br>iPad: 			Tim reflects<br>Magic Mouse: 	Tim deflects
"He could have showed they are at least a bit down to earth at Apple admitting magic mouse was not the most amazing product. But no, at Apple, everything is amazing all the time."
Imagine if this was with jon prosser 💯
tim cooks voice sounds AI
This interview is already fantastic and I&#39;m only 6.5 mins in. But I just love Apple&#39;s emphasis on privacy and how hard they work to secure it. And how Tim said &quot;privacy is a fundamental human right&quot; I totally agree. So good. I hope this value system doesn&#39;t change as new people take on the company in the future.
How about folding phones?
I am sorry marquis but every time I Watch your vid I am scared of your hand. No offense
Mark! When are you going to interview Jensen Huang?
"Man, to think of where you started in Tech and where you are now, shaking Tim Cook&#39;s hand, is freaking inspirational. Also, I hope off-camera you asked him very nicely to please focus on getting a macOS-like experience to the new iPad Pros XD"
"I just watched the Hot Ones episode and he said he rather not talk to Tim Cook, yet here we are"
The audio in this video is uncharacteristically wayyyyy dirty. Super odd from Marques.
Please ask about the display line issues on iphone after update 🙏🙏
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=362"">6:02</a> domain expansion?"
How you like to see things in fantasyland no way justifies what you are doing. Again big companies taking us all for idiots. Insulting.
Q: AI - A: BS on steroids
Can’t trust what MKBHD’s reviews anymore….<br>I could clearly notice from Galaxy S3 and S24…. He might gets sponsors from Samsung.
Good interview!
Why didn&#39;t you ask him why did Tim Hook drop his own $AAPL shares if they are so good? Will Apple need to ask Microsoft AGAIN for some $$$$ to keep on business?
"Where&#39;s the CROOK? I&#39;d beg for Leucotomy using Apple Pencil a thousand times before asking for support to Apple Support. Thank you Tim, GREAT JOB with APPLE NON-SUPPORT TEAM, whose employees even dare to send DEATH THREATS TO MY FAMILY, now in my INBOX with PRIVATE NON-SECURE DATA that you STORE IN YOUR APPLE SERVERS. Thank you MISTER CROOK."
He barely responded to the questions😂
He just said a whole bunch of nothing
I like that Tim just refused to rank them. He&#39;s a PR God haha
"Sorry, but what a poor and underwhelming interview!<br><br>A one in a lifetime chance to meet the CEO of apple for an interview - and then this???<br>These kind of questions?<br>Playing games with him?<br><br>Keep up your good work for tech reviews - but stay away from people and interviews ..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a>  Who out of time also remembered the trend video...inidi biginign"
Loved Tim&#39;s rankings 🫠
Kinda wish you followed up on previous unanswered questions from past interviews about the ethicality of their cobalt
"He really isn&#39;t very reassuring about how &quot;thoughtful&quot; he is about how his products are implemented or impactful or present risk, at least not enthusiastic about the &quot;thoughtful&quot; safeguards they&#39;ve &quot;deeply integrated&quot;, just a load of nebulous, platitude-like aw-shucks &quot;we&#39;re Apple, come on man!&quot;.  Does he even really like tech?  By contrast Jensen is a high megawatt enthusiast selling his tech. Elon an erratic idealistic achiever, Bill still seems pretty engaged with technical matters.<br><br>Marques, was this a press junket by Tim giving x interviewers 15-20 mins of time or was this a very specific, exclusive, special calendar entry sit-down with yourself?"
Ask himm about prices
"Love my Magic Mouse.  Owned lots of mice over the last 3 decades.  It’s my favorite by far.  Ergonomically perfect for me.  Maybe you guys have freakishly large hands.  I’m sure your spouse is glad you don’t like the magic mouse though, so relax."
can somebody explain how I minimize this video on my phone and it still plays? no premium btw
"He said the thing, he said AI"
"He speaks like a CEO with well rehearsed answers. As someone interested in hearing the CEO of the worlds secondmost valuable company speak, I wish we got more raw replies. Like saying the Magic Mouse being an &quot;incredible moment&quot; that is to piss on the aformentioned iPad and Macbook Air. They were and still are for some reason top five in market share for computer mice so I guess it&#39;s &quot;good enough&quot;.  No surprise ansewer tho, the guy keeps a low profile, stays out of trouble, and I respect him for it. Keep the shareholders happy and the company stable."
I think he&#39;s tryna say I want your money
been watching for 14 years. This is surreal to watch.
"Well done bro, really loved this interview"
"The ergonomics and charging of the Magic Mouse are garbage, but the touch features of the mouse itself have always been pretty nice."
You could tell Marques was trying so hard not to laugh after Tim talked about how impressive the magic mouse and its ergonomics are.
I just wanna know if he asked about RCS? ... time stamp?
"If we have 2 Sims in the Phone,  is there a way or App to make it connect to the fastest Cell Phone Network,   <br>Want it to Auto connect connect to the faster Network, so we don&#39;t have Swith Data Network to choose"
#1 should be iPod
"Apple, take note of what I&#39;m about to say... Does Tim not realize that his entire company is based on a single product, the iPhone? And let&#39;s be serious, the iPhone is not what it was many years ago and the iPhone is just another phone. This dsys all phones are good. So... Apple is playing a very dangerous game, because it hasn&#39;t invented anything since the iPhone."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> Magic mouse ergonomics - MKBHD managed to maintain a straight face. Bravo!"
Can you please review the Light phone 3
"I like how he actually answered the questions, but everyone in the comments did not have the capacity to see how that was an actual reasonable response.😅 Y&#39;all dumb"
Too many ahhhhs and ummms from someone in his position. Not impressed.
"&quot;You can&#39;t connect the dots looking forward &quot; - Steve Jobs<br><br>&quot; We dont look in the rear view mirror we just look forward&quot; - Tim Cook  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=560"">09:20</a>"
The Magic Mouse? He cannot even remember it. HAHA!
Why you are not reviewing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra?
Seems Tim wasnt sure if MKB had an iphone for a second there😂
Highlight of Tim&#39;s career
Was this shot with a iPhone?
There is no privacy and security at all in any device all companies share customers data to each other and benefit from your data
Ngl Tim sounds pretty ignorant
"Let’s talk about AI “devices”, device, device, device, ……. Let’s not talk about Shortcuts being insanely bugged. So much AI, and I cannot yet set a “working” timer to go to sleep when I use my MacBook, although the feature is there, reported and still not working since 2022, but the problem according to Apple Support is that it only fails on my Mac and I cannot RTFM. Sure… let’s talk about AI hardware and planned obsolescence Designed by Apple in California, now using brand new AI algorithms."
"Wait, is this video real? It&#39;s not AI generated? 🤔"
"Wow, really great questions MBK! Tim is clearly at Pro Max level with his answers but you got a great interview. Can’t shake this question though..I wonder what his comment would be, if any, had you used the Pixel instead of the iPhone for this interview."
Tim speaks really carefully. Most careful CEO probably.
"Hey, Marques, blink twice if you are still held captive at Apple headquarters....."
Just now starting to recognize AI?  LOL
MK is probably not allowed to express doubt on this interview about the Magic Mouse. I too don’t like this mouse.
What are those shoes Tim is wearing?
"Hey Marques, anything about Jonathan?"
Great job asking the magic mouse question. Now we know what Apple means when they say it&#39;s just another great product. Great answers from Tim Cook.
AHHHHHH my mans Marques looks asdfjkl ready to start throwing hands to start arguing I LOVE IT adsfjlk;s
But did he tell you about the conjoined triangles of success?
"If apple look forward, why they use the old-model chips set to their normal iphone series (I mean for iphone 14 &amp; 15)"
"The way Tim talks is so bizarre and makes my tism sensor go brGhhh, reading the subtitles is so weird like who is this old white man"
What Nike&#39;s are those that Tim is wearing?
That zoom when he said ergonomic 😂😂😂
Let’s hope they’ll start working on a new mouse after this.
Does anyone know what model Nike Tim Cook is wearing?
Ngl my brain slowly died throughout this video trying to figure out what Tim was actually saying 😂
". . . Nice interview, but wouldn&#39;t this be better if he actually interviewed Sam or somebody actually in charge of AI? like OpenAI or Microsoft?"
He said AI
Magic mouse... He did not remember of it (looks like)...
Tim is now permitted to get an MKBHD tattoo
"You&#39;re on CNN, Marques, about the Fisker Ocean, and Fisker filing for bankruptcy.<br> <br>The Ocean was also the subject of a review that month by American YouTuber Marques Brownlee titled, “This is the Worst Car I’ve Ever Reviewed.”<br>“Do not buy this version of the Fisker Ocean,” reads the video’s description. <br>The video, which sent Fisker’s stock plunging after its release, has racked up 5.7 million views so far."
The magic mouse was the child he forgot about.
😍🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
Clearly lying when talking about the Vision Pro lol<br><br>But great interview
Bro please tell me best laptop for mechanical design engineering
"AI is the same as the &#39;cloud&#39; was couple years ago, it just sells, rather than computers in another location, or data in another location."

What kind of rating was this ..😂..?
He sounds so much like my boss

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> he is trying really hard not to laugh here lol"
Honestly he came out less &quot;robotic&quot; and &quot;corporate&quot; here than when he speaks in the keynotes. He should probably have more casuale interviews like this one. Good job Marques.
Total corporate horse crap. Could have interviewed an ai robot instead.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a>"
"whole interview was just promoting apple &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;principles&quot; instead of giving away something useful or interesting. can&#39;t blame or judge, i mean, as a ceo do whatever u want but interview is useless and boring"
"Seeing Tim focusing towards the vision and culture Apple has, seems to say him being a very management person instead of a techy guy,. We instead are really interested in seeing you meeting with Craig to talk about the more techy stuff! ♥"
"பெண்னின் பின் துவாரத்தில் மீசை வளர்வதுக்கு நல்ல Cream ஒண்டு சொல்லுங்கள் ,பல பேருக்கு பிரயோசனமா இருக்கும்"
"Apple Team and Tim are believe they were not born from their mother&#39;s womb, but rather from an elephant&#39;s rear end. Additionally, there are some people who seem to prefer this nonsensical idea."
"In the future, all objects will be able to speak, because this is the next era after smartphones."
The camerawork when talking about the apple mouse is top notch
"I guess this is my first time actually watching Tim talk, and I am really in awe or the man.<br><br>I&#39;d say he even handled the Magic Mouse question pretty well.<br><br>Those zoom-ins on Marquees face tho 😂"
how could he not laugh at that &quot;With the magic mouse?&quot; such a professionist
Very slow and calculated answers
Bro when will you finally admit that you work for Apple ?
I love how the camera just zooms in when Tim was talking about the Magic Mouse and Ergonomics 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=988"">16:28</a> h ranked absolutely nothing…and I feel like this was a great time for Marquese to mention that he felt like it was more of a 1.2 than a 2.0 version of the OS"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=129"">2:09</a> gotta say it…this is a gangster move…Marquese knows he has the power to say it straight up…so he does…and I love it…”I’m not gonna just talk behind your back…I’m gonna say it to your face”"
"Marques, the (nobody), is not asking questions but questioning Apple&#39;s AI implementation. With a little phone and a platform to make little videos, you feel like you can question the big Tim...😂"
The awkward pause...then Marques&#39; hesitant eye roll on the Magic Mouse...
In the rankings the Apple Watch wasn&#39;t mentioned? Maybe I missed it?  I believe the Apple Watch is a  top device?  Great video thanks Marques
We cooked
"Wrap a wet paper towel around your beverage and place it in the freezer for 15 minutes. This speeds up the cooling process, making your drink ice-cold much faster than simply placing it in the freezer alone. The damp towel increases the rate of heat transfer due to rapid evaporation, a trick that many people are unaware of."
Please tell this old man about the Samsung uncrush incident
Tim looks like a grandpa trying to pretend like he knows technology.
This dude knows exactly how to answer a question buy framing it in another light lol
I will say Tim’s answers were very interesting. Especially the CEO question. He sounded like there will never be another after him
"Breaking news: corporate answers are still boring in 2024. Thankfully, the editing on the magic mouse section was top notch!"
He sounds like a politician
The magic mouse was a stealth bomb
I use passion fruit
No punches thrown. 0/10 interview.
Tim sounds so nervous
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=870"">14:30</a> you can see Tim Cook thinking and lying about it."

What a magic moment seeing Tim Cook struggling to say something positive about the magic mouse! 🪄✨
The only incredible thing about the magic mouse is how Apple even went through with its production.
Even Tim struggles to explain Apple&#39;s logic behind the magic mouse.
AI is so stupid.. when will the maddness stop
I love the way Marc submits to Tim.
The irony. Ergonomics.. why Tim.. now people bash Apple all over again 😂
Bla-bla-bla
TLD
Interview got awkward when you started trolling with the Magic Mouse and the game too. Going downhill. Think positive dude.
Here’s the real answer to the scam of ai. Is full self driving ever going to happen. Nope. Know why? Because ai can’t do it. Period. It’s a scam. So ride that bubble boys. You’ll deserve the pop
Is tim real or is this ai

Good Interview !
Why isn&#39;t Marques reading his notes from the S24 Ultra this time?😉
"God, this was so hard to watch, Tim is not relatable at all, it is painful to see how hard he tries to have a conversation like some marketing robot. I have nothing against him, I love the apple products but this and the all these keynotes are so fake that it gives me the chills."

"Hey, Tim..The ranking thing was supposed to be a game; it adds a dimension of entertainment to what would otherwise be you talking about how every Apple product was a huge moment..."
Tim Cook had to close all his rings before this meeting.
"Don&#39;t get me wrong. Apple is a good tech company. But admit it or not, the only thing saving it from obsolescence is its ground as a status symbol. Oh, and their camera as well."

I wish someone would ask him - why in the world can a modern iPhone not shoot a 4K HDR timelapse in its default app?

Magic mouse was such a curveball lol

Trolling the CEO of the world’s biggest company with a mouse that can’t be used while charging might just be MBs defining moment.
Trolling the CEO of the world’s biggest company with a mouse that can’t be used while charging might just be MBs defining moment.
“With magic mouse..(?).. okay…” 😂😂😂
He&#39;s definitely not as good as anticipated as his way of conversation reflects
"He&#39;s a corporate focused CEO, definitely not like Jobs"
A little stiff and reserved in Vision Pro comments and maybe because it’s as entertainment-focused at this point. Perhaps a fun but not work functional product.
"This is a really good interview that you did,thank you for this and I also love Tim as the CEO he has did an amazing job with Apple and he seems like a really good person."
"I would suggest asking this question: With Apple introducing new features every year, ways of doing something always increases. E.G. Emojis, Memojis, Animojis, Genmojis etc. This can get overwhelming and confusing over the years. Does Apple, a company known for simplicity think about this and goes &quot;we should simplify here&quot;"
Boooring
Thanks!

Cool video
Marques acting like a villain asking Tim to rate magic mouse.... absolutely loved it
hahahaha the face of Marques when Tim described the magic mouse as &quot;ergonomic&quot;
Not having a rear view mirror made apple to implement simple things others have it for a while
Not the dramatic zoom in while talking about Magic Mouse 😭🤣
AI versus Authentic Human!<br>Our tools shape us<br>Then we shape our tools
"Ranking, and Tim never gives us any number. Great."
What Tim Cook likes the most of vision pro is Windows
Tim finally gets his spotlight with MKBHD!
"When this guy uses the word “thoughtful” wish, I feel like he thinks the whole world is filled with fools and he is the greatest salesman. I’m glad Apple did not join the generative AI band wagon like every company on android and they have taken a different approach, but this one really needs to understand. People are not idiots. Truth is the lack the vision with which Steve Jobs introduced Siri and they never had the ability to realise its full potential and have to ultimately rely on third-party development which was their core skill to come up with radical new technologies. I just hope they don’t fall further into the pressures of competition, and do it responsibly at least maintaining the Apple way, so to say"
We want to give you tools so you can so incredible things…<br>He’s citing a quote from wwdc 2018
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=700"">11:40</a> we know u arent first bucko but you definitely arent best either"
Tim Cook has Biden vibes…
Marques wants to play a game but gets a 6 minute apple commercial 😂
Proud of you bro keep it up 💯
"LOL the moment Marques said the Magic Mouse after the Macbook Air and the iPad, I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t see that coming 🤣"
So. Many. Commercials. :/
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> <br>😂😂😂"
"the INHALE at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> Lmaoooo. He had to hold it in. Great content"
I think MK threw the Magic Mouse there on purpose 😉
Great video man. I really enjoyed that one.
bro basically just interview a book
"Worked at apple in the 80´s and have been through the up and downs all along ( I have most of their products )   I can honestly say the drive of the company is gone, all they care is the bottom line and the $$$, quality in design, repairability, and built in growth is GONE. basically the went the Ipad way on all their products,  Zero upgradeable and dead end usability with planed obsolecense and  device disposal.     Steve would never adhere to anyone´s AI      But that is the end of civilization as we know it.      All in the hands of Bozzos (as Steve would have said)"
"Woah ! After a whole year of bi+ching about apple and iPhone, he’s finally here to s the d 🙌"
Tim Cook discussing tech and AI is like getting a sneak peek into the future.
"I guess you just can&#39;t turn down the opportunity to interview Cook. But he was never, ever going to say anything of interest or value. He&#39;s the ultimate corporate bot to the point where it&#39;s actually creepy. It&#39;s hard to imagine someone less human. I mean, he ought to be utterly fascinating. He probably is underneath it all. Maybe he will be a decade or so after he steps down. But I doubt it even then. He&#39;s consumately political, so I doubt even after he&#39;s retired he&#39;ll let anything of note slip."
Focus on the “we believe….”
"Tim&#39;s legacy quote is pretty goated NGL.<br>Focus on what you can control, let others think what they want."
As soon as marques  said magic mouse i immediately said five
"Not focused on the rear view, we get it Tim, you’re a top just fvcking apple as well."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=545"">9:05</a>"
Marques Brownlee is the Jim Carrey of the tech world.  If you do not agree with me then Marques is becoming the Jim Carrey of the tech world. &lt;3
Tim Apple!!!!
The thing that got me: &quot;We use the same silicon....well...not the same silicon but similar&quot;<br>Does an M series server chips exist? Would love a fast home lab that takes only 15-20W but to be proper fast :D
"Am I the only one seeing that the entire left side of TC is slightly shaking, like he has tremors? He surely cannot be nervous for an ordinary YouTube interview, because he&#39;s not shaking on his left hand or left foot. He is holding his hands mostly together, and he kind of calms his left hand around the wrist next to the watch a lot with his other hand, and moving the right foot very much all the time. Do we have to worry?"
Apples focused on privacy but they’re going to integrate Open Ai who will have a literal NSA agent in their board. For sure it will save and won’t have a back door whatsoever. Gtfoh
I don’t know who’s to blame but iPhone software is dog shit. Can’t find any messages properly and the call log’s length/memory is that of a fish. Makes me miss by Blackberry. <br>Make the iPhone practical again not just dumb useless fun BS features no one’s ever going to use.
"Goes to talk to Tim, and he brings along his iPhone 😂😂. Very cunning 😉"
Will Apple ever make their own agi?
idk.. something is off with this guy
"If he has fallen into youtubers then he already accepts the loss, no matter what he says. Looks bad for him."
Tim cooks can&#39;t take Steve jobs position but at least he should try to be honest. It&#39;s a stretch to expect Apple to make an innovative product under him. All apple&#39;s products since Steve jobs has been incremental or partnership like this open AI thing.
Just want to say I&#39;m so proud of you brother And thank you for representing us with absolute class!
What is with the audio of this interview? It’s annoying.. as if it’s trying to sound spatial but can’t
"what an absolute honor to be able to get this far in your career... proud of you, sir"
Bro didn’t even rank nothing
He talks like Apple is the only company that does not have an NSA backdoor. Give me a break...
"Awesome interview, MKBHD, thanks for sharing this with us <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/EvkfY6uNC5OykQOewoCQAQ""></a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=386"">6:26</a> what does it means &quot;you decide&quot;? Can the user choose to send info to openai?"
Looks like you need to revise the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse again Timmy
✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
@mkbhd You look absolutely not-excited conducting the video!! 🥸
&quot;It was also an incredible moment.&quot; Like talking about your kid getting a participation award.
Can’t believe you’re sitting down with him right now
"I love my iPhone and my Apple Watch, but from all the features they have Siri is the most shitty one. It never works :-( Apple is late to AI and therefore has to buy it from OpenAI. You can try to ofuscate it calling Apple Intelligence or vague talking about privacy. I understood, apple is not going to pay anything to OpenAI for its use. That means OpenAI is going to get paid with user data; so far goes privacy …"
AI is fall prediction and avoidance not detection @sensoriahealth
That thank you for coming was HARSH 😂
"It’s weird to call Apple the on-device company. The first years of Siri only worked on the cloud, your audio sent to Apple processed and Siri’s audio sent back. Overtime the hardware and models got so efficient, that now most request are on-device."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=935"">15:35</a> we need a ai generated photo of tim cook crying with a VR headset on."
Definitely Magic Mouse is no. 5
This is purely a response to Elon&#39;s tweet
"indeed , apple put more wood behind private/secure/n ROE kind of fewer arrows...<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/heart-stripes-pride-flag""></a>"
bro cooked the cook
Two people with very different skills in communicating. Wonderful seeing them interacting together. Definitely a memorable interview!!
Dude where&#39;s the Xperia 1 VI
He said arrangement rather than partnership with OpenAI lol. Shots fired
How the fuck he got escaped from ranking? That&#39;s crime
16 minutes of non-answers lol
Why not talk about apple not making an external dongle DAC for high quality audio for those who prefer wired connection?   And why they don&#39;t talk about the quality of their device&#39;s  internal DAC? Why pay 200 plus dollars for an airpod when you can buy a very high quality Digital To Audio Converter with a very good IEM or in ear monitors? If apple promoted this external dongle DAC technology we could find it more in the markets.
"Tim knows nothing about Apple products, he is just super good at business stuff. Absolutely Sh** interview"
Based video
Good looking out marques brownlee !  For making the YouTube fullscreen extend nicely on iPhones !
You&#39;re so cunning bro. The Magic Mouse...really??? 🤣🤣
Magic mouse🤣
Vision Pro is THE GREATEST piece of technology Apple has EVER released.  Tim is completely correct that being able to preserve memories in 3D is an experience you cannot experience ANYWHERE else.  I love the Vision Pro and I cannot wait to see how it evolves over the years.
Your right to Privacy is gone
Jooo iphone 15 pro for €980 or wait for iphone 16 ?
"Apple manager  Tim <br>The company&#39;s manager the most is an empty mind, as if he was a 5-year-old kindergarten When comparing interviews with interviews such as Google Manager, Snapdragon, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, or Sony ...<br>I don&#39;t have Apple&#39;s manager, Tim, as deep as the genius of Steve Jobs, who was a genius.And not a superficial person and he says his interviews will applaud himself for the first person to buy an iPhone and his products are personal and all lies, praise and reviews only I hope someone will come back to the Apple administration that has a deep mind like Steve Jobs Not a puppet person, superficial thinking, and empty talk like Tim Cook, who considered him the most failed manager of any company in the world, especially with limited thinking like children."
Crap interview. So predictable...
&quot;How so?&quot;...an underestimated powerful question!<br>Great interview MKHBD
- Getting the ergonomics well done was key<br>- With the magic mouse?<br>- Yeah<br>- …ok <br><br>🤣
"Never given MKBHD a thumbs down, usually he&#39;s amazing, but all of us could&#39;ve lived happily if this &#39;interview&#39; had never seen the light of day. What corporate nonsense is this man rambling about? And I get it, the shareholders, the risks, but I honestly wonder if he wouldn&#39;t have been better off just admitting the magic mouse was a mistake. They happen. &quot;We tried something, it didn&#39;t work. But it goes to show Apple is not afraid to try things out in developing, and sometimes those things work, and at times they don&#39;t.&quot; I mean look at their portfolio, noone in their right mind would say they&#39;re bad at designing products, but sometimes they miss, like all of us, and he would&#39;ve had more sympathy from me admitting that"
"Hahaha .. the magic mouse ? really ? this was an extremely tricky question, you wanted to say : it&#39;s a crappy mouse that doesn&#39;t work while charging."
Yeah I don&#39;t think Tim understood the blind ranking segment.
"Can barely watch MKBHD or Unbox therapy anymore, its literally just a sellout mainstream BILLBOARD and this point, both channels, there isnt any real reviews, etc. Marques is better but they both are just lost in the sauce now it feels like. everything is just PR PR PR PR PR PR PR,"
I would have asked why the iPhone 14 Pro models aren’t supported for AI.😂
Tim apple was about to die when he mentioned the Magic Mouse
Sellout
dont tell me you had the s24ultra with you🤣🤣
"You need to stop sucking up to these people, Marques."
Tim is cooking!
Tim cook be like what am i seeing in the hand of MKHBHD is it Goggle Pixel 8 pro or galaxy s24 then he&#39;ll be oh relax it&#39;s iPhone woohh wow!😂
too many fake emotions in this AI talk😂 and Apple  or Tim don&#39;t wanna say that they&#39;ll explore the AI technology and will increase the price to their customer as always with that new innovations.
Marques ist the best. Loved it how he skipped the &quot;blind ranking&quot; when Tim wasn&#39;t comfortable with it. Such a good and polite guy!
"Wow, congratulations Tim Cook😂😂😂"
This interview is spiked. Without detail &amp; now meaningful output from Cook. Why? Because Marcus is “allowed” into WDC24 conferences and review devices treated as a VIP. So he’s too scared to challenge the CEO so we end up with a game in the end! Useless content
Tim is posing he does use Apple products.
Could you tell me what is tim cook’s shoes?
This video gave us nothing. Tim Cook never gives us anything of substance.
&quot;The magic mouse&quot;? Tim pauses for en eternity while he realizes: &quot;That is a really shitty product of ours!&quot;.<br><br>Marques had a really hard time not start laughing when Tim started to waffle about the ergonomics of it. Well played Marques!
ask him how much he paid google to buy their AI
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=952"">15:52</a> OMG, I understood &quot;I lost both of my parrots&quot; and i was really confused. I just realized he said &quot;I lost both of my parents&quot;"
"Omg, apple shares skyrocketing after blatant lying. Mkbhd I love you ❤"
Security Security Security
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> when tim thinks marques isn’t using an iPhone, &amp; marques swiftly confirms that he is 😂"
10 more minutes and Tim would have cried.
Dude that was an interrogation not an interview!💀
"Marques, that folding leg move was unexpected! It looked like your knee almost touched your face. What a powerful move!"
My Ranking - (things that MADE Apple the $Trillion$ Company it is today):<br><br>- iTunes -&gt; LET THE WARCHEST BEGIN - Apple would still be a small creative computing company without the Billions in revenue Apple made from iTunes sales before any other tech they produced after it<br>- iPhone -&gt; (yes it did change the world)<br>- App Store -&gt; super valuable for Apple in generating their overall wealth in their biggest growth period after iTunes implementation - made multi millionaires overnight and larger billionaire developers<br>- iMac -&gt; macs for the masses / and great school and SME adoption than ever / tower-less design and with the first G3 iMacs of &quot;98 making computing cool and featuring heavily as props on extremely popular teen TV shows ie Buffy the Vampire Slayer - running through to every other iMac design iteration (and in general the G3 macs including the towers)<br>- THE CREATIVES WHO STOOD BY AND USED MACS RELIGIOUSLY AND WERE THE BIGGEST FANS AND SPREADERS OF THE BETTER COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM THAT WAS THE MAC OS - these are the people whom because of their religious-like following and support of Apple in times when they were almost doomed to disappear (just prior to Steve Job&#39;s return in the 90&#39;s) - the final reason Apple is still here today<br><br>Of course there&#39;s also the iHub concept Steve Jobs introduced...in either a late 90&#39;s or early noughties keynote
Wow! an interview with Tim. That’s awesome!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> The magic mouse and the slow zoom after that 😂😂😂😂😂"
Has he answered any of the questions. Its like mkbhd is asking questions about fruits but he was talking about agriculture
Wtf dude ? Where&#39;s the Xiaomi 14 ultra video?
All Apple Fans don&#39;t reflect Apple products
🇺🇦
"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UW5IY-ibBqa8jgTymoCIBQ""></a>AI is replacing alot of us including any and all types of related designers, writers, artist, engineers, etc. In my opinion it will be the downfall of us all. Company&#39;s are choosing to have less employees and have AI doing once human jobs. That South Park episode when they said &#39;&#39;<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>DER TOOK UR JOBS&#39;&#39; hits harder now!!!<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><br><br><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/RPkfY8TPGsCakNAP-JWAoAQ""></a>If they keep this up AI will surpass humans as their creator and rid the world humans.

"Sorry, but Tim failed miserably at talking about using the VisionPro. MKBHD wasn’t impressed."
TC seems like he&#39;s slowing down a bit...cognitively.
I liked the legacy portion of this. Still think an official museum area in Apple Park would be cool tho
The pleasure is all Tim’s
"some of his answers, like how it was never about keeping people glued to their phones, conflict with the message given elsewhere, like developer documentation, which suggests that engagement IS key. <br>But other than that, MKBHD is definitely getting better at these interviews!"
Need AI in glasses. Not like Vision Pro to view entertainment…. Just info
Legacy isn’t part of the culture? That’s a shame. Its a great legacy and so much to learn from especially when looking forward. Great interview 👍
"I only have two questions for Tim Cook:<br><br>1. When will Apple fully, honestly, truly, get on board with Right to Repair?<br><br>2. When will Apple return to a more eco-friendly manufacturing model?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a>"
The Magic Mouse 😭😭😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> Marques’ face 😂"
"Should have pressed him to rank man, there is being <b>too</b> polite sometimes."
"You looked quite short with SuperSaf, here you look taller."
"Got a lot of work to do to make full use of these opportunities home boi. You’re only halfway willing to engage on the hard questions. You may ask the question, but you’re not following up with your full articulation and thinking on whatever the issue is—either because your afraid to upset Tim, or too nervous to have the confrontation. You’ll have to take that leap if you want to move on from “tech reviewer” to tech journalist or interviewer. It’s easy to trash everyone’s tech and play troll when you’re talking to a camera, it’s a little trickier when you have the other person across from you. You don’t need to treat Tim like a baby, he’s the CEO of Apple. He can handle it. And you can avoid offending him by being earnest in explaining your concerns. But throwing these “tougher” one-off questions at him (like your question re Apple’s integration of privacy into their AI: “How so?”… [then nothing more]) then reeling back and disengaging like you know better is kinda annoying to watch. If you want to hit the weights, watch Hamilton Morris interview Michael Pollan on his book about psychedelics—that’s a good display of the sort of fearlessness you ought to be incorporating. Just my two cents."
Bro had Tim Cook right there and didn’t bother to mention Congo smh
"Big fan here! as an African entrepreneur myself I truly admire you.<br><br>I desire your advise in my New startup in two innovative apps I am currently making, wish for a response from you."
They probably signed legal agreement to not talk about something that would make them look negatively and already knew the content of the whole interview.
"Alright,you all don’t like the mouse,I get it..<br>But what shoes are those?<br>I’ve been scrolling for minutes now and not one of you has asked the most obvious question..<br>Geeez.."
Shot and edited on iPhone? 😇
I wish Marques asked Tim what he thinks about Google&#39;s Pixel and iPhone friendship animation series. 😂
"Great interview... At age 68, the tool I want that can do incredible things is an Iphone with a display screen that adjust and can be read in outdoor sunlight.. Is that too much to ask??????"
Based on this interview I’d assume Tim Cook has never seen or touched an Apple device 😅
honestly..that was a complete waste of 16 minutes and 32 seconds
Ayuh.
this mf voice sounds AI
Utterly boring
Seeing MKBHD&#39;s face when Tim mentions ergonomics and magic mouse in the same sentence is priceless!
It&#39;s so good we&#39;ve got a youtuber and interviewer that really questions important points regardless of who is.
"I almost believed that Apple makes things for people, not targeted at people… In the end, everything is cold calculated and ends in for shareholders pockets…"
&quot;tim know they belive us smart friend&quot; lol ... two roads buddies ... the illusions of safe us .. or the wired eyes on us ... choose just blue or red .. call how u want ... always been .. always ll be  .. just mind world game.

What Nike model is the one Time wears ?
Yep the iPhone did change the world. Now every idiot either walks around or drives around with their faces buried into their devices.  Great change.
When you say we want to give you a tool so you can do ‘incredible things’ what make a phone call
Apple Intelligent = AI<br>A-pple<br>I-ntelligent
"Lets be honest, Apple is doing this interview because Musk´s declaractions on X  LOL."
But why Apple make so many mistake? 😢
Asking an apple ceo about potential significant decrease in mobile tech usage is just like  asking an oil/gas company ceo  about the importance of furthering the science and development of renewable / alternative environmentally less polluting and cheaper fuel sources. 😬
Marques had the &#39;right phone&#39; this time.. 😅😅
"This is a great video, I watched it with pleasure. I look forward to new developments in the field of neural networks."
&quot;Hi Steve can we do a blind ranking?&#39; <br>&quot;No.&quot;
"NIKE SHOULD CONSIDER ATLEAST GIVE YOU COMMISSIONS EVEN IF IN THE FORM OF SPONSORSHIP, THAT&#39;S A HELL OF PROMOTIONS 😊"
"Impressive Marques, A classic of being the best at what you do can take you far. Sitting down with Tim Cook is no small feat. Kudos."
MKBHD looking pathetically sheepish in that video. Totally unimpressed by his lack of courage and insight with Tim Cook.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> TIM: “inni di binninginggg”"
The game at the end was  a frustrating watching experience.
Benefit to the user is really benefit to Apple&#39;s bottom line.
Tim’s explanation of why they call it Apple AI made no sense to me lol
"Tim; &quot;Well he can&#39;t topple us&quot; <br>Assistant; &quot;Mr. Cook, remain social, not too much details on anything&quot;<br>MKBHD; &quot;Magic Mouse&quot;<br>Tim; &quot;Ah fk no&quot;"
The servant and the Master at the same table! Now that is generosity!
This vedio works differently on my phone lol
sb know the name of tim’s shoes?
What bikes are those
lol data secure on the device not in cloud yeah that one made me laugh
"After this interview, I bought a magic mouse. I decided to try it for myself as it was designed (not using right click, learning the gestures, and scrolling). A case can be made for its ergonomics. I like how thin it is to fit in a bag, and I hold it the way it was meant to be held in my fingers. It&#39;s day one, but I like it; hope they don&#39;t change it."
You damn well he was wearing the apple vision 2 testing apps lol
In the blind ranking he didn&#39;t literally rank anything....for him everything is the best😂😂😂...typical Apple
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a>... marques&#39;s reaction is &#39;really&#39;😂😂😂"
Tim was visually uncomfortable about the blind ranking. He’s like this on you right? Lmaooo
Bru the Magic Mouse scene was so annoying when can Tim just acknowledge that jon ive messed up 😭😂😂😂
"The fact that Tim didn’t know what phone was sitting on your arm rest, tells me it’s time for a change in the iPhone design"
"I would love to see the base of the iMac be upgraded to house qi charger for my phone, AirPods watch and yes charge the “Magic mouse “ wirelessly . Nice interview !!"
Dodged everything and even spoke about how one day they&#39;ll be a new CEO... Like .. no body asked
The influence this guy has in the tech world is HEAVILY underestimated
"Unpopular opinion: the Magic Mouse is actually great. Not a troll. Not a contrarian. And I&#39;m not an Apple fanboy. Some of their products are very overrated. But I&#39;m legally blind so I zoom constantly and the one tap zoom on the Magic Mouse is amazing coupled with the ability to effortlessly horizontal scroll after you&#39;ve zoomed. Every other mouse I&#39;ve tried has comparably awkward zoom and/or horizontal scrolling included the much beloved Logitech MX Master. And ergonomically, I find it far better than the Magic Trackpad, which causes my right index finger to get stiff."
"No, Marques! You cannot put in this video&#39;s thumbnail Tim wearing the same shirt as he actually is in the actual video but you have an entirely different clothing in the same thumbnail than what you&#39;re actually wearing in the video."
I said let him cook !
Ergonomics of Magic Mouse and SLOW ZOOM stole the show 😂
Tim was struggling with magic mouse lmao
Poor Tim didn’t understand the game 😂
If everything is done on device what happens when you switch apple devices? Does the intelligence model have to relearn your “habits” or will it transfer via the cloud? Then it won’t be solely on device unless you did manual data transfer.
his voice like a robot<br><br>magic mouse hhhh<br>lol
Please make a quick review on the light phone 3.
Man had to reconfirm when Tim said ergonomics was the key for magic mouse.🗿
Oops that&#39;s super boring 💤💤💤💤💤
"Apple products are good, no question. But only for as long as you stay a user and don&#39;t try to develop something"
I&#39;m sure Tim was overjoyed when his response was compared to that of Lebron James 🤣
Well said about legacy. Many Ceos tend to focus on legacy rather than concentrating on products.❤ Thank for the show
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> that’s Apple"
What did Tim exactly say? Everything he said just went over my head
Marques be nervous 😬
mkbhd is just a plant now lol. absolutely 100000% useless interview .
its tim apple not cook
Apple pro reminds me of ready player one❤
Tim Cook=zzzzzzzzzzzz
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Should have picked an easier item, maybe the <del>iWatch</del> Apple Watch instead of the Magic Mouse 😂😂😂."
So the actual level of goodness for magic mouse is not well done but medium rare
"So he just started off capping,  smh"
Apply is just a waste phone when conpared to andriod phones - by an iphone user who thinks that was a mistake to buy iphone!
Tim is showing his age a bit here. Not as sharp as he once was
Yes what Apple is doing is Better Because everyone is different. Will need a different personal private Meta program. The AI assistant should be programmed from the Owners MetaData. Not the Crazy Perverted World Wide Web. The General stuff is a Multi input AI and it&#39;s filled with crazy people. Apple isn&#39;t making Psycho Terminator IBM AI Androids. It&#39;s making a Helpful Stacked A-MAC I-PROGoBOTs.
Saint internet. <br><br>Tim Cook being the honorary president of tech implementation and like it not it just tech and not just geopolitics but like the moving targets of real lives in the different iterations and East Asians Americans are so lucky but East Asians cracked out on their two data points and couldn’t move beyond ugh whiteness and their their weird uncle doing their dank gulag take out. Please don’t nvidia me that gulag dank. On what levels does that dank even care. <br><br>MKBHD making key points in iterations in tech to so many people and young people to feel involved. <br><br>The conglomerating. 🌊🌊🌊
"they way you sit in front of a CEO, no matter which companies CEO, it&#39;s inappropriate"
"Tim is probably one of the best persons in not saying something wrong, but honestly the &quot;emotional&quot; moments when viewing photos on Vision Pro is very much wrong imo. <br>First, the things you look at after that update are not what was happening in that moment. Most of the time it will get close, but if there was another person behind for example the scene shown on stage the computer would cancel every last memory of this by giving you the illusion to look around in that moment (only a couple of degrees, i know) but its just made up.  Secondly, VP is probably the most unsocial way to look at photos. Its by design a screen noone else can see so you are locked in a tiny, lonely world looking at moments you experienced with other people. Sitting together and looking at photos would be emotional to me, but this??<br>But other than that, I find you struck a good balance between not offending anyone and smooth but rapid changes of topic to challenge Tim a bit in not saying something wrong."
MKBHD “Apple is notoriously famous for never sending anything to the cloud.” Since when :-D
U can feel that he was lying when talking about the vision pro
Le Tim Cook
Cliffhanger they put them in cows 🐄 under the winter actually make more and better milk 🥛 XD the farm will need some security
Imagine marque using the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra as his note taking jotter 😅while interviewing Tim cook.
"The crossover we didn&#39;t know we needed. What a great interview although his answers were sometimes not quite answering the questions… But what should he do, he can&#39;t spoil too much."
Bill gates lite goes crazy
Well has to kiss Don&#39;s ring I guess (to put it nicely)
Apple sure has a loooong winded way of saying simple things.
Tim&#39;s a good man.
Is that the attempt to reply on Elons X Post about banning Apple products in his companies? Than it was quite weak
"What a great interview! Some great, cerebral, questions there!<br><br>I think at the time, there was a feeling that Steve Jobs WAS Apple, and that without Steve, Apple was dead in the water. Then later I think there was a similar feeling when it was announced that Sir Jony Ive was leaving Apple.<br><br>Without downplaying either Steve or Jony&#39;s incredible contributions, I have to say, that having used Macs since 1991, the hardware and software is better today than it has ever been. Apple just seems to keep going from strength to strength!<br><br>Long may it continue."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=773"">12:53</a> &quot;oh my god&quot; that&#39;s not an exclamation of awe about the iPhone. that&#39;s pure relief from dodging the Magic Mouse conversation 😂😂"
Improving people’s lives translated is squeezing money to improve shareholder lives
"Wow, that magic mouse moment was so awkward. Loved it  😂"
make iPhone cheaper and easily accessible for us
Less confident Tim Cook we’ve ever seen
"The magic mouse, we saw that look in Marqeues eyes"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> it is real?"
Garbage iphone
Magic Mouse aaaa ummmmmmm..  getting the Ergonomics right is the key with the Magic mouse (MKBHD nodding to it on behalf of us )
Does someone know who designs his thumbnails ?
"You did it. I mean, you already did it multiple times over the past decade. But you finally did IT. MKBHD and Tim Cook!"
"Can we talk about the fact that TIM COOK, just sat with MKBHD?!?!? That conversation&#39;s content was lackluster at best, BUT, the fact that his publicist said &quot;gotta make time to talk to this youtuber&quot;.... Epic!"
"Marques should be CEO of Apple, just an idea.."
What a dry interview.  Tim Cook might be a good executive but he&#39;s not much of a media personality for me.
"Sir let&#39;s rate apple products<br><br>All products were good products, they were revolutionary, they changed everything, they are the best, I will not answer any rating and just repeat this"
This guy didn&#39;t answer any questions 😭😭😭
OMGOMGOMOMGOGOGOGMOGMGOMOMOM!!! HOW DID YOU GET COOK TALK WITH YOU??
"&quot;We&#39;ve always Been focused on Privacy&quot;, Dammn tim."
Thank you for this info...
“We feel like” yea that makes me feel secure using AI 😂😂😂
@mkbhd should ask *Have you ever tryed Galaxy S24 Ultra*???
Crash and fall detection failed me last year and I&#39;m missing my fucking calf so the scooter crash was bad and Apple says no it did not happen. Canon and GoPro along with 6 people and the huge scar on my leg says different.
we are glad seeing you supporting small concerns like Apple
Tim acting like the Magic Mouse was made by Herman Miller&#39;s Aeron Remastered team or something lol.
Bro scared to use his S24 Ultra in front of Tim Cook
"That interview once again highlights general mindset of shareholders of tech companies. As a ceo, to make sure your stocks are up and running (in terms of Apple’s after wwdc even flying), you need to stay positive about everything to the extent when it sounds somewhat bizarre. Thanks for this insight!"
😂😂
Perhaps Joe Biden and Tim Cook are becoming too close
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=146"">2:26</a>"
I just wanna know what shoes Tim is wearing 😅
Hi Rushie I have been watching your videos for a long time <br>Honestly this is the best video I have watched from you.<br>Good luck bro
"&quot;the magic mouse isn&#39;t as great an achievement compared to the ipad, but i think it was up there&quot; i agree too tim, a mouse is as important as a laptop"
selling your privacy is their priority haha
Mkbhd+tim crook before gta 6
❤️👍
You can see Tim’s watch while he talks. I wonder what’s on his watch.
So.....he didn’t want to play the ranking game.....
Whaaaat you made it in life if you have a interview with james
Marques by leaving his phone out shows just how disrespectful he is of others and how hooked he is to his phone!
"Now invite Carl Pei next, and we can see a different vision other than these mostly corporate ceo answers."
Whats my legacy?  3 trillion dollars beeeotch! 😱
Tim Apple himself uses Logitech MX Master 3s and he is here talking about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse ☠.
Did this billionaire just say “ekstablishing” multiple times???? Am I crazy?????
"Great interview! I’m a lawyer, and I use the MB Air, the iPad, the Apple Watch, and of course the iPhone every day. Thanks, Apple!"
"Elon Musk is on his way, Watch out Tim 😂😂"
whe he said getting the ergonomics marques said &quot;the magic mouse...&quot; and was holding his laugh in so hard
tim is getting cooked in this interview lol
i like how he didnt rank any of the stuff
Tim seems to not be answering the actual questions asked but answering them in bs corporate speak.
Tim Crook
"I&#39;m glad you mention in the podcast that these type of interview is useless.  I personally don&#39;t care to hear Tim Cook&#39;s personal ad for his company, when there&#39;s no opportunity to ask hard questions.  If I want to see an ad, I would watch and ad; but this is supposed to be an interview and I have a higher bar for scrutiny with interviews."
"Just answer the Qs bro, he literally responds like a bot and just says apple bs- not sincere or authentic"
"So iPhone changed the world huh? <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/6_cfY8HJH8bV5QS5yYDYDg""></a>"
"The whole interview was literally just reminescing about the Steve Jobs era. You can tell Tim only knows the barebones of the product and wouldn&#39;t actually be able to tell you how Machine Learning works, or how does the M3 Apple Processor differ in its market. The man is a businessman, not an engineer. Steve was both."
I just loved Marques’ clarification when TC mentioned ergonomics for the Magic Mouse. 🤣🤣
A drink to the word &quot;privacy&quot;
Does anyone have massive battery drain on the new M4 ipad pro? I read the apple discussion section and they said the battery drain issue are very bad. It dropped by 30-40% overnight when sleeping
What a guy. Cool interview but its so clear these are such PR answers lol. He totally deflected giving a blind ranking probably didn&#39;t want articles written saying &quot;Tim Cook ranks iPad as BEST Apple Product!!&quot;
"Really stumped him with the magic mouse <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> 😭"
When he said ergonomics with the magic mouse I could smell the irony hahaha
Let him cook 🧑🏻‍🍳
Why didn’t you ask for reasonably priced hardware
"I honestly didn’t like to see Magic Mouse in the list. By far the least important product, IMHO."
slippery as a snake
Marcus you’re blowing up. Keeping pushing the envelope bruh..
Magic Mouse 😂😂😂
Ask him about airdrop
Marq wants to be in the moment<br>&amp; Tim wants to fill in the space!
Swave on both sides (and not just the shampoo) IDK I mean I think its gonna be tough for Apple in the next few years or untill something they have right  now pays off.  Or some one makes &quot;the killer app&quot; (remember that saying?) for the XR stuff or something. All the best to them I hope something hits
"Oddly these devices as stated were created to allow people to do great things, yet nobody creates much of consequence ever... Most people stare at the tool and float inside its most minimal purpose... If Apple developed an iHammer and it became popular then most people would be walking around with a black fingernail and a knot on their forehead"
I would like to express my cordial distaste of Tim Cook and Apple in general. Good day.
Does he know anything technical what is telling.
Fun fact:You can double tap a comment to like it
"That &quot;blind ranking&quot; was a miserable failure, he just discussed. No ranking was made.<br>Fun fact: Stanford Research International (SRI) invented Siri. And the mouse. And the internet."
I love the reaction of Marques when Tim talks about the &quot;ergonomics of the magic mouse&quot; Its too funny.
I wasted 16min listening to Tim giving corporate answers. Zero useful information received.😅
"why does he seem so cooperate here, i feel like in the dua lipa interview he was way more chill"
"why does he seem so cooperate here, i feel like in the dua lipa interview he was way more chill"
Tim Cooke looks like the guy Steve Jobs shat on
"Marques: last but not least, Vision Pro<br>Tim Cook: ohuh ... oh 😩I love the Vision Pro, I was just using it last night 😩😏💦"
MOVE THE DAM MOUSE CHARGER TIM! :P
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> Marques lowkey trolled Tim by asking him to confirm he meant the Magic Mouse in relation to ergonomics 😂😂😂 What a goat!!"
It is intriguing to learn that half of the Fortune 100 companies are choosing VisionPro for their projects.
Even Tim knows the toxicity of MB
That magic mouse one as kinda messed up tbh. Tim did fairly well but I didn&#39;t like the smug look on Marques face
Excellent teaching.
I wished Steve Jobs was still alive and MKBHD would have interviewed him
Do enjoy your videos.
"tim cook needed steve jobs for bravery. tim seems like a good boy, but unsure if he’s doing a good job. not too confident for a CEO of Apple. <br><br>truth is - he polished apple quite a bit, moved to M1, kept all the products in good shape, and continued to push very high levels of engineering and innovative high technology. vision pro is actually a great example of tim cooks work. dedicted, lots of work put in, meticulously executed - to the tinest detail, and with very cutting edge technology — but! without a real use case / user understanding.<br><br>Failure of the iPad’s software stems from the samw place as the failure of usability for vision pro, i think. Tim doesn’t seem like a “product owner” - he is a great executioner, maybe the best, but needs the likes of steve jobs - to own the product vision, and tell him where they need to go.<br><br>I think he admired and loved steve a lot. I think his responses show that. It felt like - oh - those were better beacuse Steve was there, and he said they were great!<br><br>Tim is a nice guy. I wish him well"
"Continuo a dire che come trader dobbiamo assolutamente trarre vantaggio da ogni mercato in cui ci troviamo. E in questo momento, credimi quando dico che il day trading di Bitcoin ha raggiunto il picco. L&#39;allenatore Mario Joseph è stato di grande importanza nel mondo delle criptovalute con le sue previsioni accurate. 5 stelle!!"
That was the most beautifully crafted “shit sandwich” I’ve ever seen with that Magic Mouse reference. 😂<br>Chefs kiss!!!
The moment of magic shit
I wish to see Zack of JerryRigsEverything in a conversation with Tim before he retires as CEO. Make it happen please.
Tim Cook 🙌
The megic mouse. He stopped for a moment 😂
"And the award for blatant lying goes to… TC.<br>There’s no way he spends this much time using a Vision Pro. And clearly there was no way to remember lost loved ones before the VP. <br><br>I wish company representatives didn’t have to be in defence mode all the time. It would be great to see someone come out and say “you know what, xyz product was a bit of a flop but we learned from it.”<br><br>Pretending we’re living in this perfect world with these perfect products that only help solve problems and don’t introduce new problems."
"Hi Marques, I love your work and I’ve been a fan of your channel for many years. I was a little disappointed with this interview for one huge reason. You should have asked Tim point blank wtf is going on with iPad OS. Do they even care anymore..? What is the future plans for the expensive sheet of glass that only 1% of the creatives will purchase..??"
Who else is watching this from their iPhone 🎉🎉🎉
"You, my friend, showed incredible restraint when Mr. Cook mentioned getting the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse &quot;just right&quot;. The look on your face spoke volumes."
Boring corporate answers....
what even was that lol
&quot;The magic mouse...?&quot;
"Tim couldn&#39;t wait to get out of that seat. Great questions Marques, bold move trying to get him to rank Apple products as the CEO!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> lmao the way marques had to confirm that they where talking about the same product and he was trying not to laugh"
What is the brand of the polo Tim&#39;s wearing?
Great interview brother!
This was so torturous lol Tim is just a deiplomat that doesn&#39;t give any useful information
Marques smile when he says ergonomics..😅😅
Honestly two of the best in the entire world at what they do.
"there should be a seperate section in the chapters of this video , named MagicMouse"
Iconic moment in human history
"Marques is a genius interviewer, Tim is a genius  interviewee"
Would be pretty cool to work for these guys
Interview was fine
"Based on Tim&#39;s response, I&#39;m actually, sincerely not sure that he even knows what the Magic Mouse is."
The guy does not even recognise a phone he helped design! That is sad..
Marques swept the carpet off of Cook&#39;s feet when he sneaked in the Magic Mouse in between the topic. He knew exactly what he was doing. 😂👏🏼👏🏼
"That guy knows tech well, should get into reviewing or something"
Great that MHKD was able to interview Tim Apple.
Tim‘s Polo shirt somehow looks crazy expensive and super basic at the same time.
"He&#39;s very good at answering questions without actually answering questions. He&#39;s like a politician except his response, while still dancing around an actual answer, is at least on topic. So points for that."
Tim reading the comments and crying in corner because he can’t turn off the comments 😂
I bet mkbhd would have never thought he’d be rich doing shit like this when he was a little Afro amerikan. Big ups to him!!
Apple is scared of mkbhd
Most FAKE ASS CEO answer: <br>Vision Pro &quot;aaah umm oh i love Vision ...  Pro&quot; 😂🎉🤯😉🤔
Magic Mouse 😂
this interview sounds like an interrogation  🥸
The awkwardness of the magic mouse segment 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=883"">14:43</a> WINDOWS?????? 🪟🪟🪟🪟🪟🪟🪟🪟"
This conversation is clear trash 👎 as a Indian android consumer I thought MKBHD will ask more meaningful &amp; tough questions to tim cook but my guess is completely Rong.<br>My 20 thousand Indian rupees phone features are way better &amp; more offering than Apple&#39;s 100 thousand Indian rupees phone.<br>In Indian market purchasing an apple phone instead of android is make no sense at all still people are buying it like a fool&#39;s just to flaunt that they are using an expensive shit that very few can afford.<br>So so disappointed with MKBHD he had the opportunity to talk with tim cook on tech &amp; world yet he wasted it on this stupid questions
Screen time is NOT something came up with.  It was something parents of BIG wealthy investors pf the hippy era FORCED them to do!
"He totally disregarded the rankings, Tim?!!!"
tim cooks
"Tim never expected any about Magic Mouse, in my opinion maybe is not the best but I think apple is more focused on trackpad or touch screens by gestures you can use."
Magic Mouse is the most un-ergonomic mouse I have ever seen 🤣
"So to give a number to the products, what I could gather was:<br>iPhone = 1<br>Mac Air = 2<br>iPad = 3<br>Magic Mouse = Could slot into 4 or 5 (he really had to think about it cause he knows the charging port placement is terrible)<br>Vision Pro = Definitely 5"
It was a fascinating interview not for the content but the visuals. Tim Cook a seasoned executive of an iconic brand and Marques a reviewer of those brands from a different younger generation.
"Tim calling him by his name after he saying everyone keeps chatting about the new CEO, and Marques licking his lips says a lot. Very uncomfortable moment for both of them. Body language says a lot in that question."
Silly Clickbait question. Can we move on from the mouse? So much to talk about and that was one of the questions that made the cut?
couldn&#39;t watch for even 2 minutes. So boring.
yo man MKBHD holding his laugh at the speak of magic mouse...damn
I bought a Logi MX Master 3S 2 months ago and that is what Magic Mouse should be. They could rename the current one to Magic Mouse Air and do this as Magic Mouse Pro.
Marques Brownlee as CEO for Apple!? hmm.. :)
"Apple- &quot;We Monopolize &amp; focus our Products towards Gen. Z&quot; <br>&quot;It&#39;s ok, do whatever. We&#39;ll protect you!&quot; <br>Android has been doing this for years. Reason why I left Apple for Samsung. It&#39;ll take you years to learn everything the S24 Ultra can do."
"Among the ways iPhone changed the world was data plans!  Jobs made an exclusive contract with AT&amp;T that they could be the sole network for iPhone for a set time, in exchange for the idea of a data plan.  Up until then, if your flip phone had a button to check the weather or the stocks, or play a game, you were charged per use, like the phone company liked it."
Here at muwhahahahaha industries
Cook sounds like the text he says was generated by AI
Cook said Windows😁
does tim cook know what magic mouse is?
Thank you MKBHD for giving Tim Cook opportunity to be on the best tech channel in the world. 🫱🏿‍🫲🏾
"It would be interesting if some exec at Apple can be cornered and forced into answering the question of if and when the Magic Mouse will be upgraded.  I guess it is hard to justify (financially) making an entirely new manufacturing line for a &quot;free&quot; accessory.  I&#39;ll always take the trackpad over the mouse, for now."
The Magic Mouse 🤣🤣🤣
"Whet the hell is this dude talking about? I was skeptical for a lot of his swerving around questions and prolonged irrelevant answers, but the moment he mentioned the ergonomics of the magic mouse, putting the consumer first and the stupid Vision pro add, etc, I was certain he is either delusional and merely marketing directed, or just straight up oblivious to the tech industry and his own company."
the humming is driving me insane
Why is apple intelligence so bad that they had to bring in chat gpt which is crap
"Now I see, MKBHD is the new Walt Mossberg 😂"
Logic outro 🔥
We have been waiting for Siri in Polish for 13 years. F****g  Apple
What kinda English is Tim speaking? Heavy accent. Is it deliberate?
When are you gonna review the samsung  z fold  6
"Damn, Tim sounds old"
Got bored from this interview because the answers are sooo CEO
Such CEO answers
I betcha at the next apple event they’ll release whole brand new apple mouse because he was thinking 🤔 shit I better get that into production for that one 😅
Magic mouse😂
"“Getting the… urrrr… ergonomics… well done… was key, I think.” <br>😂"
"Guys, google what Unimantic is, and don’t worry about exchange rate volatility anymore."
MKBHD: So what&#39;s new about the iPhone 16?<br>Tim Cook: uhhhh.. the price?
Tim Cook is as exciting as paint drying😅
Definitely won’t ever own an iPhone again as long as ChatGPT is any part of their software
Tim is boring
"for someone who is a millionaire, he has terrible teeth"
He makes himself seem like an imbecile. sad that he could not speak more openly and show his true opinions. i think mkbhd was very giving with the questions etc but tim cook acted like a criminal at interrogation
I didn&#39;t understand the ranking...nothing was ranked?
"Good work Marques. Just personally, I would have rather seen an interview like this with Craig for the more in-depth product knowledge. Thanks for another good video."
Mans is getting BANNED from the next WWDC
Thanks
"Why you got to do him like that with Magic Mouse dude. It’s not like he’s a hyper technical person, he’s just an operator and skilled at giving PC answers. RIP Steve Jobs."
AI is not apple
"Oh shit is that Tim Cook?? “personal friends and donator to the Israeli Occupation Forces” Tim Cook??? “Homies with a genocidaire” Tim Cook???? That’s class, Marques!"
You should have asked when will they make 512gb as standard for Macbook?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=177"">2:57</a> i thought mkbhd uses S24 U , guess he can&#39;t hide the truth that he is a sheep at core"
I could swear that Tim Cook is NOT using a Vision Pro
Marques asked him why they don&#39;t say AI 🙈
Lmao he refused to play along with the ranking game
There&#39;s no free lunch. Can you guess what it means ?
Huge R E S P E C T for MKBHD for stiffling the laughter with Tim Cook&#39;s Magic Mouse response.
THIS DUDE SEEMS TO BE VERY WISE?
Who else is watching an apple interview on their galaxy s23
Why is Tim low-key kinda jacked???
looks like ikea&#39;s vimle
In the password app - can you have attachments in an entry?
The &quot;not looking back&quot; part was a very Jobs thing. It&#39;s how he lived his life.
For me the whole &quot;privacy&quot; is a little bit hard to believe after deleted images were not really deleted.
Tim Cook really has alien hands if the Magic Mouse is ergonomic to him
I think this is the last time any Apple employee make an interview with Marquees. 😂
"Is &quot;being dishonest&quot; in the job description when applying for CEO? Lol Never gave a ranking because that will hurt profit margins potentially killing any of the bottom 2 products, He probably knew this was obvious to everyone watching and still that was his decision, like he couldn&#39;t help lying. Comparing them to children... that was just lame. Also pulling the dead parent&#39;s card with that overpriced, cool but yet useless VR headset, not his brightest moment. And ergonomics is a word that should never be used in a sentence referring to ANY APPLE PRODUCT, especially that abomination of a mouse. Sleek, clean lines, minimal design and beautiful software UI: definitely."
"It&#39;s not a person speaking. It&#39;s a commercial or a press release. He&#39;s speaking for the shareholders, not for himself."
Tim answers questions for Rankings like I answer my community medicine questions😂😂😂😂
"Private Cloud Compute concept is nothing new for tech folks deep in core US industries. 😂😂😂 Apple always find a way to make existing technological paradigms sound fancy and revolutionary once they jump on it. 😂😂😂 Hey, don&#39;t blame the game!!! Lol."
Tim Apple is a cool guy
You won’t find a museum but you will find that hefty expensive Apple Design book that I really want but can’t afford.
"They branded AI because it&#39;s a feature that only the latest phones and devices can support. So now you they can sell the iPhone 15 Pro and say &quot;supports Apple Intelligence&quot; etc, same way they sell the latest Apple Watch and say it supports Crash Detection. People will know instantly what devices they need to get the features they want"
Tim always sounds like he’s making stuff on the spot…
I really wanted Tim to break character and admit that the magic mouse is Apple&#39;s worst product.
tim couldn&#39;t recognise the device 🤔
Apple sus for this so many wierd words that feel like twists.
Why you didint ask about the new ios
"Im actually curious if apple going to bring back the 2015 MacBook 12 inch design back and slap an apple silicon into the MacBook, you might be able to ask that"
As an android user I love this from Apple 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾🤜🏾🤛🏾 Good job Apple 🙏🏾
"Someday maybe video like this can be generate by AI, wish that day never to come…"
"I&#39;m a bit disappointed, I expected Marques Brownlee to come out in front of Tim Cook with an Android smart watch and an Android phone because you say that you prefer the Android system to IOS. &quot;Tim Cook oh Marques so you have a watch&quot;, &quot;Marques see Tim I also have an iPhone15&quot;. This was a bit sycophantic. It is the shame of the moment."
Please review the new nothing buds
"If I may, I feel that the Magic Mouse could be a great mouse. It just needs to be more ergonomic and have the charging port in a less stupid place"
Such an artificial video
"Apple doesn&#39;t look back but they will sell you a $300 book on past designs... they might not have a museum, but you can buy a $300 book."
"Its all marketing just mention Ai, and all investment company will pitch their money at the stock."
the zoom with magic mouse killed me x)
"I don’t usually comment on YouTube platform, but this was great. Tim is a brilliant man."
Marques pressing F for doubt big time when Tim mentions ergonomics of the Magic Mouse.
Well done Marques! Your videos are always meaningful and honest. Thanks for your work.  I&#39;m just wondering how this person became the head of Apple... honestly my 15yo sun would give better answers.
Can someone tell me if AI is apple intelligence in this video?
So that is why you never do negative- reviews that could damage Apple <br><br>VISION PRO USED IT LAST NIGHT - Liar 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tim really did not understand that game
"Tim Cook, who came out on the side of the Constitution in the wake of J6, now runs to The Diaper Don to kiss his ring (or whatever part of his anatomy), and give the Don some big money for access.  My current computer is an Apple.  My next computer will not be by Apple.  My current phone is an Apple.  My next phone will not be!  Shame on you, Tim!"
This was the softest interview
"Another Fanboi interview. &quot;We&#39;ve never talked about the technology because we only talk about benefits&quot;, call him out on the times they have talked about technology. &quot;We are secure because we use the same silicon at both ends&quot; That&#39;s irrelevant (unless they were using quantum which they are not) what matters is the transport."
Tim stop acting line you’re doing us all a favor. How about right to repair Timmy.
Steve Jobs must be rolling in his grave and saying: &quot;Aaaargh!!! Is this guy still running and killing innovation in my company?!&quot;
"Umbilical cord, that&#39;s what the Magic Mouse nowadays comes with instead of a tail. That must get the cats very confused.<br>Cat 1: &quot;Hey, have you gotten yar mouse today?&quot;<br>Cat 2: &quot;No man, can&#39;t find me none. Maybe they all got &quot;Cooked&quot; by someone else.&quot;"
What a waste of time.
The way the camera started zooming in when Tim said &quot;Ergonomic &quot; bro i watched it 3 times and started laughing im sure im not the only one 😂😂😂😂😂
"As someone that got his first WWDC scholarship in 2002 and who won an Apple design award as a student in 2003, it sure feels weird to hear Tim say there were no students in the dev community before the App Store."
&quot;AI for the Pro 15 of us&quot;
MKBHD swapped the Samsung out for this one haha
One day I&#39;ll have Tim Cook&#39;s hairline.
Happy to see that Tim&#39;s activity rings are all full
Never missed Steve Jobs more
I did not think Marques went easy on Tim at all. Excellent interview!
&quot;Our model is not one where we need engagement to succeed&quot; was a pretty strong and interesting statement
So glad MKBHD took the time to talk with a small creator like Tim Cook! What a time!
Apple intelligence they&#39;ve just learned how to give u a calculator 😂
those socks
His lips were flapping but he said a whole lot of nothing next time get Steve Wozniak on to talk about same things
-The iPhone. <br>-OMG. I’m bout to bust.
Magic mouse was a brutal question. 😂
Blanket answers but nice to see this interview.
"I have a dream that one day we black people, will not be defined by violence but by our intelligence 😂."
"Brilliant that you got to talk to the man himself! Shows how much you have grown and succeeded, so awesome! And with regards to Tim dodging every question yet answering them in his own way, this guy is representing his company, all eyes are on him, imagine him saying yeah we made a mistake with how the magic mouse is charged, there would be literal headlines straight away, as this is the rubbish gossip world we living in where no one is cheering success yet is celebrating downfalls. I think this was a great heartful interview."
"I know you don&#39;t want to lose out on future opportunities like this, but man, have some integrity and ask some real questions instead of simply giving Apple your platform."
shame that you scored this interview after Apple became so lame. my personal phone (samsung a71) is still better than the iphone 15 pro my work gave me.
"Marques controlling his laughter at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> &quot;15 yeah&quot;🤣"
Really cool
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> When someone is not buying your corporate BS cause their livelihood doesn’t depend on it"
it doesn&#39;t feel like an interview. More like giving Tim a platform to talk about how great Apple is. Doesn&#39;t feel like he was at any moment challenged or really honest. It&#39;s more an extension of their keynote.
"That &quot;15, yeah&quot; was so subtle and smart"
When the calculator will be launched on iPads? Still waiting.
Congrats 👏
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=440"">7:20</a>&quot;Our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed&quot;<br><br>SHOTS FIRED 🫢"
14/6.
Tim rocking the Pegasus 89
Let tim cook!
The look on Marques face after he mentioned that it&#39;s an iphone 15 is just priceless
Apologies in Apple lingo: &quot;15&quot;
They really just had to nail the “ergonomics” with the Magic Mouse huh
Hey Tim stop banning Alex Jones you establishment shill.
Going into this thinking &quot;maybe this uber-high-level professional will have something persuasive and real to say about the value of the AI craze&quot; and he starts with &quot;AI is when we make you something fun and nice :)&quot; like what
“DONT SAY FEATURE DROPS MAN - YOU HAD ONE JOB”
"I clicked away for a bit, and I was confused why a Biden speech was playing in the background (not trying to play politics, just saying). He&#39;s speaking from such a from-afar, comfortable, abstract perspective. ISOMETRIC. Like...&quot;if money and maple syrup just flow straight into your mouth - like when you&#39;re counting those 20 properties you bought for $200/piece in 1974 - THEN YOU UNDERSTAND Apple&quot;. Like... don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re basing all our decisions on 30 years of your consumerism [so we&#39;re making the best product, OBV].<br><br>Then contrast that to Marques who clearly has a focused, interested, and active mind.<br><br>Satya Nadella isn&#39;t much better than Tim, but at least he has some nuance.<br><br><br>Maybe this is a harsh take. But I expected much more from Tim&#39;s side of this interview. Kids in 2024 have the attention span of a squirrel. You can&#39;t just rattle off a bunch of 2003 SEO keywords."
"Marquees in minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=438"">7:18</a> when Tim says &quot;We&#39;ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices&quot; He wasn&#39;t buying it😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=921"">15:21</a> talking about all the unemployment from college kids creating AI programs to replace themselves 😂"
Well done on closing all your rings Tim
"PR Agents : Tim, make SURE you say the word &#39;Privacy&#39; 24,394, 394 times<br>Tim : Yes!"
Sometime i wonder if nike is part of apple.. 🤔
talking tech with vangaurd controlled proft driven corporation pushing globalist shit on the population
Never go full Apple! 😅
Bro he wanted to screem when he talked about the MAgic mouse xDDDDDDDDDD :V hahahahahahah ohhh no xDDDDDD
NIce kicks
Man the Magic Mouse moment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=759"">12:39</a> Marques is like &quot;what absolute bullshit&quot;"
"Who else noticed the ear piece on Tim’s right ear, giving excellent replies on a lawyers point of view. 😊"
"Tim Cook, &amp; really any high level Apple representative I&#39;ve ever seen interviewed have learned the art of taking a question, &amp; turning it into a pitch for their products. I get the sense that they fully believe in what they are saying, and the subtle way of turning those questions into almost commercials. is the combination of pride in their products &amp; having spent a lot of time with PR experts. Then there is the reverence toward Apple, &amp; Tim Cook, that causes those that interview them, to not hold Tim&#39;s feet to the fire on, well, anything. Especially those who review products, &amp; have a monetary interest in staying on Apple&#39;s good side. I&#39;m looking at you, iJustine!"
"Honest question for investors. Why does Siri need OpenAI sticky taped onto it? After 13 years of Siri development, why would Apple ( the king of walled gardens ) be doing a deal with OAI on a flagship product like AI, instead of doing it all, in-house? Are they that far behind MS and GGL in development?"
&quot;Ekstablish&quot;
well done with the magic mouse<br>hopefully Apple will still let Maeques interview them in the future after this
"Is this an interview for Tim to get hired as a grocery shop CEO? It feels like that’s his level, very unimpressive."
"I just noticed that the MKBHD guy put his leg in front of Tim&#39;s face. In my culture, that&#39;s not polite at all."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=440"">07:20</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=465"">07:45</a> is probably the most important part in this interview in my opinion. I feel like there might be a time lurking around the corner, where people will actively want to use digital devices less, if at all. And I reckon Apple is aware of that, has been for a long time and is laying the groundwork to be less present in our lives while still being irreplaceable. And I for one am surer curious where this all leads.."
It&#39;s awesome you got to talk to Tim Cook he&#39;s a surprisingly chill dude for a CEO
Did he put his S24 on the sofa&#39;s arm?
Tim knows the magic mouse is shit
"Gets to the Magic Mouse, Tim still hasn&#39;t ranked anything with a number... cuts to Marques who totally doesn&#39;t seem annoyed."
Where’s the mic?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=733"">12:13</a> best part"
"11 hours standing before 4pm is impressive, Mr. Tim Apple."
Let&#39;s see what this pro apple channel has to say lol
Would ask him where are the billions spent for the car 😂
Marques so messy😂...bro really wanted to confirm if they were talking about the same shii.....&quot;the magic mouse&quot;😂😂
This man is talking out of his ass about the VisionPro HAHAHA
Tim Cook is a really nice dude tbh
"Feel like if a comedian did a funny Tim Cook impersonation, it’d be pretty hilarious"
Well done!
Sound like job interview... cook keep on turning round d Bush bout vision pro. Hahaha
Apple&#39;s WWDC opening visual is perfect example of the phrase &quot;PRIDE🏳‍🌈🌈 goeth before a fall🪂&quot;
Don&#39;t let this guy Cook
Ergonomics and Apple Products can&#39;t be mentioned in the same sentence.
The magic mouse was let go too easy
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=747"">12:27</a> That&#39;s Will Smith meme right there 🤣🤣🤣"
Apples new product after this interview: the brand new ergonomic iMouse with included smart charging port that isn’t on the bottom
"Hell yeah, love Tim Apple 👎🖕"
I love how Apple people explain so simple things as important things with great explanation. 😅
Leave it to a PR professional like Tim to squeeze as many feature-drops and value-adds into his descriptions of the products as possible. Well-trained.
"I respect the critical approach to this interview. He’s on our side, the side of consumers. He wasn’t there to frame apple in a good light, but have a genuine conversation with Tim. Very respectable."
Will MKBHD now been shooting spatial YouTube videos for the Vision Pro with the new camera announcements coming soon

Listening to all this marketing bs is like a visit to the dentist. As IT guy it’s just another hype hype hype. And in real world you get the MS Copilot which is utter crap. Well…..
"It&#39;s so stupid to think that data privacy is real, to be exact , these companies know more than we know about ourselves."
Wasn&#39;t the AirPort the first Air product?
The fact that Marques came from reviewing smartphones from his bedroom to interviewing Apple CEO is peak motivation
"The last day was using the S24 Ultra, but for Tim took the iPhone 15. 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> Magic Mouse"
The reaction on Marques face when he mentioned ergonomics. LMAO!!!
I remember that Charging under the mouse that&#39;s Hilarious 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=421"">7:01</a> Im sure Apple earbuds will have AI integrated so you can do all forms of communication verbally"
"Pretty sure Tim Cook has completely forgotten the Magic Mouse even existed until that question came up. &quot;Ergonomics&quot; is something that applies to <i>other</i> mice, not Apple&#39;s."
Great interview .  He didn’t quite get blind ranking but it put him really on the spot with Steve jobs legacy .  iPhone has to be top
"Journalism is asking and writing about what other don&#39;t want you to. This was not even an interview, Tim Apple simply handled Marques as part of the marketing campaign like how a politician would. ASK DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AND THEN CALL OUT THE CEO&#39;s BS. Stop saying: &quot;ok&quot;. Ask follow-up questions that makes the CEO sweat."
"It is a pleasure to see Tim Cook&#39;s deep knowledge about his company&#39;s visions, and productions, and I&#39;m sure he knows everything about the processes. It seems like a basic things to know for every CEO. Still, meanwhile, CEOs of national companies and ministers in Kazakhstan know so little about their field, that they could&#39;ve been saying on national news, that the iPhone 11 is coming soon. At the same time, everybody can already buy an iPhone 15."
Look at him lying about Magic Mouse and Vision Pro lol
I wonder if they confiscated Marques&#39; Galaxy S24 Ultra at the door lol.
"My wrist currently hurts, like as I type this, because we use magic mice at work."
"Really interesting interview, a good mix of challenge and respect."
corporate responses
Bro are these bot comments? Everyone is saying the same f*<b>***</b> thing. We get it!
"Hear me out. I actually loves the Magic Mouse. It’s one of the best accessories I have for my Mac, do use Remote Desktop to my desktop pc from the Mac on a separate screen and I use the mouse for that computer as well."
The Truth: Apple has failed to deliver its Own AI. I was expecting more then just an integration with ChatGPT.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> Tim Cooked 😅"
"Thanks for that, really good questions and very interesting answers."
OK
Ъъ.
I&#39; so relieved that even a CEO like Tim Cook can say dumb things such as how magic mouse is ergonomic :)
not sure if he ever used a magic mouse
Magic Mouse = Getting the Ergonomics right = Platinum Trophy
He dodged the generative Ai question
"Hahaha, the slight sass marques gave about the magic mouse,😂"
He does the second best Tim Cook impressions.
Hell that was nice! MKBHD only ..  thank you
"Magic Mouse, err..... errr.... err...."
Tim choosing every single word wisely 😂
Marques is messyyyy I live 🤣🤣
always funny to me to hear apple or google say &quot;we take privacy very seriously&quot;
Hello Tim Cook! What’s your name?<br><br>His answer: Privacy is our main concern. <br><br>But I asked you about your name!<br><br>His answer: the industry is moving forward.
Speaking like a true Apple Salesman. Using General terms to stop giving out specifics (The Apple way) and always pushing the Apple agenda in every statement.
Is this for real? Or is this an AI demonstration? He is talking to an AI isnt he? What a PR bs machine.
"Honestly, at this stage, Marques is basically the king of Tech."
Came here just to listen to the magic mouse ergonomics 🤣
You just know Tim Cook immediately called the design team and demanded they work on a new mouse RIGHT NOW! 😂
"When Tim started explaining iOS 18, it was like Mr Mackey from South Park giving a tech review—definitely unexpected! &#39;mmmkay&#39; 😂"
Sell off 🙈🙈🙈
would Steve Jobs be proud be Tim if he was alive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=915"">15:15</a> jjk refrence 🗣️"
He failed miserably at this interview. Apple is too big and Tim Cook just showed that he knows nothing about his own products. He sounded uncertain. Now imagine Steve Jobes giving this interview...
You got him with the Magic Mouse In the top 5!!
VWDC? what Volkswagen have with Apple? xD
"Tim thinks of Apple products as his kids/nephews/nieces! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=647"">10:47</a>"
Tim Apple and MKPHD 🔥
"I love when you ask clear questions and people ramble without giving an answer, I&#39;ve seen this behavior mostly on people who work in management. I guess if you want to be CEO this is something to learn"
Nice 👍
"The most telling comment is about Apple Vision Pro and Enterprise apps. This is where the usecase is for the foreseeable future. Engineering, architecture, etc."
"He&#39;s like a doll in the hands of the company&#39;s top management. He doesn&#39;t even know anything about his products, reading from a piece of paper like Biden."
Definitely made Tim uncomfortable
Tim Cook has really done a fantastic job leading Apple.. so glad Marcus was able to share this time with him..
"&quot;We don&#39;t like looking to the past. You&#39;re not going to find a museum here,&quot; he said from the Steve Jobs theater."
I think Tim is high on something 😂😂 because my brain 🧠 can&#39;t brain now..
"$60,000+ in royalty’s from YouTube in one day from this 16 minute video"
pretty morally bankrupt message there in the last minute
Access = profit
thanks tim apple
"This was too suger sweet, no hard questions asked"
"Magic Mouse, the worse Apple product ever"
Is Tim Apple sponsored by Nike?
"besides the obvious non-answers (magic mouse and incredible ergonomics?), it was cool seeing this interview, and shows how much weight Marques has now!"
Great work like always. You asked great questions on the limited time.
yeah he aint gonna be invited to wwdc 25
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a> marques is trying so hard not to laugh lmaoo"
lmao those ‘in the face’ zoom ins when talking about magic mouse are wild
Boring
I’m an Apple fanboy all the way!
Apple is the greatest company in the world
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=952"">15:52</a> oh no, did he not..."
Tim Cook is ripped.
This is crazy
Man he barely answered any questions.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> HAHAhahaAHAHahahAHAHahAHa"
Tim Cook is an absolute clown 🤡
Somehow this video turned out to be the funniest video I&#39;ve seen this year.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=575"">9:35</a> &quot;You won&#39;t find a museum here&quot;, but you will find a $250 coffee table book"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=736"">12:16</a> Ergonomics for a wind tunnel! 😂"
Tim got Cooked.
Now I have a newfound respect for Marquees.
Magic mouse... Ok 😂😂😂
Can’t stop thinking about the Key and Peele sketch.
"The most boring, incompetent questioning an interview can have. Just because you have established a reputation doing one thing, it does not automatically mean that you are good at everything else. The interviewer doesn&#39;t even know how to ask a question or receive an answer."
never answered one question..
"Somebody help me out, what&#39;s the problem with the magic mouse? What&#39;s the joke?"
I will never consider buying a tech product without looking at a Marques review/analysis
"First in the couch, then we go to bed together"
I like listening to the MK interviews with Tim.  I hope Apple does not lose this suit with government over its own system. If you want a watch to sync with your phone buy a Apple phone.  There are numerous Androids out there where your watch can use their phone.  The EU is next you can bet your socialist euro on that fact.
"I used to don&#39;t like your videos very much man I&#39;m sorry, but THIS ONE WAS GOLDEN. You asked with a blank face about the Magic Mouse, that was GOLDEN, this interview changed my mind about you and your videos. Congrats man"
Tim Cooked
"Ooooo, that was cold. Apple will probably think twice now before scheduling another Tim Cook interview with you, MKB!"
Tim Cook is fucking talking delusional.
He&#39;s so full of crap.
Go Apple go..........How about complete A.I. systems on our IMAC Tim......All A.I. .........Tools......Imagine garage band A.I............WOW
"honestly this interview could be shorter: &quot;we look at what android is doing, then our marketing team comes up with hyping it up - 5 years later&quot;"
bro this interview is so awkward😂😂😂
2007<br>Intelligent phone= iPhone<br>2024<br>Apple intelligent= Ai<br>2032<br>Magic&#39; device<br>MD
How is the Elon musk says they cannot control AI but Tim Cook says they did in a way where it is secure?
"Regenerative Harmony = EQORIA, United Earth. Almost Ready. 12.12.24"
It&#39;s crazy we live in a world where I&#39;m not suprised to see a youtuber sit down with the CEO of apple. Marques keep up the great work. kudos.
It’s quite impressive to achieve such a degree of influence/relevance that one is able to command the attention of one of the most influential people in tech for as long as 15 minutes. <br><br>Tim Cook has really come a long way!
"Kudos to Marques for trolling Tim about the Magic Mouse, that sequence made me cringe so much 😅😅"
i know apple mouse got lot of hate. but i somehow still use it  since 2015..
When he mentions the magic mouse the zoom in effect hahaha
wow felt like Tim got decimated and dissected !
"Muchas gracias Jorge,  excelente la información ."
“Lebron answer” is INSANE
bullshit interview for MKBHD audience who crave for value driven content. <br>I am not even exited for the future of apple by watching this…
His legacy will be the vision pro LMAO
Tell me a product you don&#39;t use and/or avoid without telling me you don&#39;t use/avoid it... Tim Cook &quot;...ergonomics... on the Apple Mouse...&quot;
Too bad iOS sux so hard in terms of ux and being so restrictive….
the close up with the magic mouse ... i cant lol
MKPHD
Landing an interview with one and only Tim Apple!?!?
"Did y&#39;all talk about how AI is Bullshit in the academic meaning of the word &quot;Bullshit&quot;?  I&#39;m serious.  &quot;impressive sounding claims without regard for truth value&quot; that is, completely regardless of falsehood or truthood.  That is what AI is.  Just blathering bullshit."
Give the man credit for staying on message!
"M4 Laptop : many are waiting for its release with m3 chip outdating and m4 already in ipad , there are no mini mac now with m3 or m4."
"@marques, you missed an opportunity to ask about why Magic Mouse has the charge port at the bottom, why iPad is still an iPad and hasn’t evolved to be all that it can be, and so many other things! Though I’m sure apple probably gives you a list of NO NO areas for your interview."
Love the Clone Wars III in the intro!
"As decline is seen on the horizon, and the effort, not desperation yet, begins, to swim against it."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=740"">12:20</a> l hope you enjoyed your first and last interview with Tim Cook 😂😂😂"
"so local AI = personal cloud ??<br>your data is within a server with everybody else data. with a lock key. a server key you own password only but not admin server rights is that privacy?<br><br>the thing i know with frontier models like openAI have in future the moment you chat with them is the moment it learn! because it learn it remembers you no data sent just 1 chat no logs no history, and the learned can be extracted anthropic already did, they can extract those data out! well this is assumption based on research developments, <br><br>aside from that nowdays they already developing the theory of 1bit quantization method if that&#39;s work it means 184 bit LLM working on device no server or private cloud.... my assumption if openai does that and build their own phone with robots how cheap will it be that personal AI phone are. well done might find my assumption hilarious, it is but i think is openai needed those money."
I&#39;ve never understood the discontent with the Magic Mouse from a workflow point of view.
Come a long way. Proud of this guy
Did not make the IPad useful for peoples lives
"one thing I can tell you, he has to step down seriously"
Steve Jobs is turning in his grave
The words he used the way he used them people who work for apple are like robots they programmed to say certain things in a certain way
what a dream dude! keep it up marques!
This man Tim Cooke is a Genius.  You. An hear his mind in his conversation.  He is so future driven.  He is beyond his time.
"I am down right impressed but Im just an old lady. I just need iMessage, Storage Space and Battery Life for the price."
Techtuber GOALS!!!
I thought the title suggests an AI-generated interview of MKBHD with Tim Cook. I wasn&#39;t expecting them to be real humans 😬
I always hated apple a d I don&#39;t think it will ever change
I lost all respect for Tim Cook on the Magic Mouse moment! He&#39;s giving off a vibe of a sleazy car salesman or politician  👎
i am sorry but i cant unhear Rileys impression &quot;Buy you mom an iPhone&quot;
I dont believe anything tim says.
I just love Maekez interviews. Very very relevant questions
4. Air   2.ipad   5. Magic Mouse    1 iPhone.   3 Vision Pro.
As a person who studies human behavior examples  non verbal behaviors! Marques&#39; reactions to some answers was classic! Señor Tim don&#39;t fool compa Marques!
Ngl they reminded me of that Last Jurassic Park 😂
He should of asked about the puck mouse
When things take less time you have to do more things.
Tim Cook flexing those closed activity rings.
Tim absolutely refusing to do blind rankings is both incredibly media savvy and I think honestly rude if this was agreed upon beforehand.
The Joe Biden of Tech…
So many original commenters on here saying the same thing
Magic Mouse will definitely be on the table for Apple to redo after this!
Bro the ranking section<br><br>Can these fossils just retire already
I think my time with Apple products is coming to an end.
"Great video Marquis! Appreciate your tough questions, but Apple going to be Apple, I will take everything everybody else accomplish. Make it smoother. Make it pretty make it! Make sure you cannot change it. Make it, make sure they control it and they are going. to have a product that everybody else is going to be bazookas over, Even though it existed a long time before they did it, I&#39;m happy they are doing it. But can we just be honest? What did Apple have created since Steve Jobs passed away? You can put Apple logo on a stone and will people will buy, grade marketing. Great strategy. Great company. Great phones. Mostly video, How is it fixing to control  Chet GPT? I hope it&#39;s works out great"
the ambassador of Apple sellers meets the ambassador of Apple users
"what a lame guy, does not even do the blind ranking of fear. THAT IS CALLED &quot;FUN&quot;, maybe have some of it. It was never meant to be taken seriously, but oh well. Not very sympathical. The rich can do what they want, even dictate the interview and everything. Was not even meant so bad with mostly good products, and not the usual FAILED things like Bendgate, Apple III, Lisa, and all the other lemons they made."
Shouldn&#39;t have crumbled - force him to rank!
"Kids, Cook knew every question before it was asked. Welcome to show biz. He runs one of the biggest companies in the world. He&#39;s worth $2 billion. If he says the wrong thing, Apple&#39;s stock tumbles massively. He&#39;s not taking an interview like this going in blind. That includes the Magic Mouse question. In fact his &quot;ergonomics&quot; answer is almost definitely a case of trolling the troll. He&#39;s not dumb. He knows people complain about the ergonomics of it."
"Do you not get passed and cause accidents when you dont look in the rear view mirror? <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
Cant wait to watch the podcast to hear Marques actual thoughts abt this interview 😂
"Legacy ... ? Let me tell you<br><br>He blocked employee&#39;s airdrop functionality who were being treated harshly and forcefully, to share videos to the world"
Amazing video
"I never liked Apple and I can&#39;t say I like it any less now. Apple has always seemed and continuous to see, so utterly pointless to me. They always failed to make people dependent on it. Apple is only ever about choice. Massive marketing phails on their part the entire time."
"The poor can also have a bad &quot;assistent&quot; while the rich get richer and get the real deal. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
1. How apple define AI in general? <br>What next? Apple will define what water and air is? No sense interview with a supply chain person who took the soul of apple away
"imaging M4 competing with B200, several orders magnitude slower"
"Keep in mind these are curated, and Marcus isn’t allowed to ask certain questions so I wouldn’t really except this as an honest interview"
"He was stuttering about the magic mouse. Yup, it’s at the bottom of the ranking."
a guy apperantly not undrerstands Gen AI. he dont understand the difference betweent ML and Gen AI
The two GOATs of the industry

Tim offer this man a job
I’m not that familiar with the interviewer but am I the only one who gets a vibe of smugness from him?
Thanks for asking him about Magic Mouse. Please gradually confront him about the port placement over the long term 😂
I guess nobody didnt give Tim a parachute for the magic mouse moment
“We always talk about benefit of the user and not the technology behind it”<br><br>Yet somehow they end up showing their processor architecture diagram during launch and quoting the billions of transistors and all the geeky microprocessor stuff? 😂😂<br><br>Double standards? 😂❤
I&#39;m sure he loved to hear the name Steve Jobs this many years later
Looks like everything is just EMOTIONAL when it come to Apple leadership 😂😂
Let him cook...
Tim is the best CEO in the world for me! Deep respect for him!!
Such a great interview. Nicely done.
So MKBHD critics Apple hard the last few videos and ‘magically’ he gets insights to their labs and chats with the CEO - gamer move. <br><br>let’s hope he stays critical
"Magic mouse.. lol.. i know he&#39;s a CEO , but get with the humility train, it sucked, it was a mistake, we got over it, just be honest.  sadly this is the problem with these kind of interviews,  they cant just be honest, Apple is not god, they make mistakes, products that are not perfect, nothing wrong with that, mistakes are reasons to innovate, just say that."
"The &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; statement is a quirky detail, and I believe Tim addressed it well by candidly acknowledging that it didn&#39;t capture everyone&#39;s attention. This approach seems more genuine than bringing it up initially."
"C&#39;mon Tim, commit and rank!"
"Honestly, this was a very unimpressive interview. Tim seemed unfocused, tired, and not in command of the discussion. It&#39;s not a competition but he could have been replaced by any average marketing director at Apple for this interview."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=413"">06:53</a> - examples - you both watch TV and you want to show somebody a picture as a pip on the TV...you cannot do that but you have to spend time on the phone trying to find the picture and then show the other person the screen of the phone. Or if you want to comment a video on TV on the fly...not possible. Or you search for a topic...even when you use ChatGPT...all takes a lot if time abs a lot and f phone fixation which should take a fingersnip of time..."
That was pretty intense
"Tim Cook pronounces it <br>“ik-stablished”?  OK, sure."
"Very interesting that Tim mentioned succession unprompted. Must be happening sooner than later, So more like one to two years rather than five"
LMAOO the zoom ins for the magic mouse. I cannot 😭😂
this guy seems like he doesn&#39;t know anything about his products lol
"Steve Jobs has more positive influence on the society than Louie, Ntini, Chunga, Allah and Reid combined."
"Magic Mouse, Vision Pro and iPads are useless. I said it."
Time Cook is Apple
Marques&#39; face when Tim used the words &quot;Ergonomic&quot; and &quot;Magic Mouse&quot; in the same sentence 🤣
Interviewing politicians has the be the most frustrating thing ever
The depth of the answers from this man is shallower than the new ipads
tim cooks laugh is not a ceo laugh!
Tim is brave for this one haha challenged him a bit
Who is the guy with the glasses?
His rankings were mid. Such market speak. Didn’t commit to ranking anything. Just gave canned speech.
Bro give his eye glass to Jerry rig and watch a interview like this with Jerry rig everything
lol at the magic mouse struggles
"Tim Cook&#39;s legacy:  magic mouse,  dynamic islands, Siri, HomePods, AirPods, Apple Pencil, MacPro wheels, iWatch, VisionPro.  Not legacy (so far): electric car, foldable phone or tablet, merge MacBook and iPads, smart AI."
The generative content thing is lame but other than that why not..
I was just thinking could Apple actually take back there products that they made
"For the love of God, give this man a soul!!"
"There is nothing AI in this world (2024) yet. This is just a marketing concept that is making businesses to profit on the ignorant.<br>Machines cannot think, we are way far away until that happen. In the meanwhile everything that you see tagged as AI is just a piece of code that a developer wrote in a very clever way to  mimic the actual artificial intelligence, giving you the illusion that it is AI, but it is not!<br>Note that some companies like Samsung do not call it Artificial Intelligence, but Advanced Intelligence, or Apple Intelligence for Apple, which is more suitable at this time, in 2024."
"The magic mouse! Clever girl… all right, I’ll like &amp; sub. We all want a refresh!"
the magic mouse shade ahahah
these questions are actually really good
"Great stuff as expected, until the blind ranking. I never heard of that but it&#39;s easy to grasp the concept. It&#39;s a game, there&#39;s little at stake because afterwards he could always make political excuses based on the premise. Not holding him accountable in a giving a number 1-5 was weak. Not questioning his praise of the mouse serves neither of you."
Tim: Those Magic Mouse ergo&#39;s Doe...  @MKBHD : <b>Suspicious Zoom</b>
Awesome interview
"Tim Cook can’t cook. Hence, you get the same dish every year"
A very proud moment for this man&#39;s career: Getting to speak to a legendary personality like MKBHD
"Can you tell Tim that not having any Al features on iPhone 15 (not Pro) is such a crime. Jesus I have the latest iPhone. I just didn’t need a better camera as it was advertised and I get it that there are specs limitations for Ram. But maybe it could work entirely on this Private cloud if I extend iCloud extension? Just asking, maybe this would be a solution. And overall they will get more user data covering iphone 15s"
Lost all credibility when he said the magic mouse is ergonomic 🤦
What about the puck mouse? No one going there?
"There’s no way Apple doesn’t know how bad the Magic Mouse is. Everybody knows it. It looks cool, and the idea of having a touch pad on it is a good one, but it’s HORRIBLE to use. The ergonomics are awful. They just can’t publicly admit that their product is bad"
Can we get a congrats to Tim for closing his rings?
Who let Tim Cook (had to)
I love the part where Cook mentions the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse and MB throws up in his lap.
Change the thumb for this vid.
"MKB be really going places... well done man, your work payed off"
"How you know you&#39;re successful...A sit down with the CEO of one of the most valuable companies in THE WORLD. Congrats on this opportunity, you deserve this"
"Seeing Tim struggle naming positive things about the Magic Mouse. And seeing Marques struggle not to laugh, is top 10 MKBHD moments of history"
"Apple partner with Open AI to steal their AI technologies that they are so far behind as we all know, Apple never invent anything, just make it better. The Chinese learn from this so well, keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer."
"So, last time Marques asked about a calculator app on iPads. There was a strange response to that, but they ended up releasing a calculator for the iPad. Now he&#39;s asking about the Magic Mouse, and I think we will see it redesigned soon :) Keep pushing for upgrades to Apple products from the outside, man! You are true tech hero!"
Paid promotions included
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=192"">3:12</a> notice how he feeds him the answers in his questions"
Tim seemed very unprepared with AI answers. It’s clear that apple couldn’t wait for the next WWDC to release their approach with AI. They didn’t want to have to do this.
"GME AMC KODK ??? Kodak Moment！<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/oPgfY_DoKfSXkNAPq8-AgAo""></a>"
Hey! Here from kempire
"Notice at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=645"">10:45</a> how it cuts after Marques prompts &quot;MacBook Air.&quot; Apple definitely wanted this cut and MKBHD&#39;s team made that an OBVIOUS cut 😅"
"Damn bro, pulling out the Magic Mouse was brutal"
Why did Apple drop the ball on Siri for 13 years? And none the Creators are pushing on that question.
Tim: Don&#39;t ask me shit about RCS
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=49"">0:49</a> seconds Tim Cook said crash detection with a straight face, but then to be fair, he said the magic mouse was ergonomic so idk at this point"
@marques Tim must so glad that you brought your iPhone instead of your Samsung
Who of you understood how the Private Cloud Compute works?
The way fans fawn over everything Marques does reminds me of the NFT crowd feeding off of hype and optimism.
The zoom on MKBHDs face after time cook says ergonomics 😂
"Time for a new CEO, Apple is really lacking vision."
"&quot;Lol, Magic Mouse! You got &#39;em good!&quot; is about 99% of the comments.<br><br>This audience is very eager to praise."
hey good shit marq
I&#39;m here to see MKBHD&#39;s face as cook talks about the magic mouse. Who else?
"MKBHD, can you please make an Interview with Steve Woźniak, this will be more interesting, but first of all more substantive ;). Unfortunately Steve Jobs no more with us.<br>Thx.🙏🏻"
Kempire sent me. 👍 new sub here.
i miss Steve jobs
"Tim cooked! I love how the history is etched in his memory, much as they look forward and do not get carried away stuck at admiring their museum. Great master stroke to not choose his favourite kids or nephews or nieces, but rather speak fondly of every single one of them"
"Seeing Tim Cook mask off at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=606"">10:06</a> is weirdly nice."
Feel like I just saw one more Apple keynote
MKB&#39;s face when Tim said ergonomic and magic mouse was all you need to know. LOL
Well that game went down the toilet but Marques you did well....😊
The most corporate CEO answers of all time 😂
&quot;Our objective is never to be first. Our objective is to be the best&quot;. Let that sink in
Tim might be looking at his replacement. Hot take? Maybe? LOL ✌😂👀
Thanks!
"Jeez, we&#39;re on a logic train these past few videos, I&#39;m loving this"
ERGONOMICS+MAGIC MOUSE=CEO BS
"Interviews with Apple execs are always kind of boring. You know nothing is going to happen, they have really good media training. I find interviews with unpredictable CEOs and execs way more interesting. Apple execs give you crap like &quot;ergonomics&quot; for the Apple mouse. Interview Elon and you will get something like &quot;of course we are making a Tesla Monster truck!&quot; ...and everyone back at the factory is like 🤬😅"
Y&#39;Know what let em cook for once
wow people from Apple do say &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;um&quot;
bro made it
Tim is getting old.
“our model is not dependence”<br>“i couldn’t live today without my ipad”
This was definitely an interesting interview. He said they&#39;re not trying to be first. They&#39;re trying to give the best experience to the user. Makes sense
Why didn&#39;t cook rate the products?! 😅
Tim loves Marques...you can see it in his eyes....Tim is trying to date ....
The worst blind ranking of all time
I love the logic intros
nice seeing Tim Cook collaborating with small creators like MKBHD
Congratulations Mr. Brownlee!!❣❣❣❣
"When you buy Apple product you automatically buy  lifetime  &#39;&#39; F*****k you  ! Pay me ! &#39;&#39;  with it  :D :D  , accept it  :D :D"
Ehem... the Apple Vision Pro just works amazingly for [.*] Entertainment!!! xD
The blind ranking by Tim Cook couldn’t be any more evasive and insincere.
"either i am dizzy, or this was no blind ranking"
I want him as our president
The private cloud compute answer didn’t sound too convincing to me lol.
i can see now why tim doesn&#39;t do many interviews
that frame zoom we all saw 👀
Great interview
LET TIM COOK
Hearing him talk is worse than a politician
"MB, you disappointed me. I expected something better since you wouldn’t stop talking about price ladder or whatever you call it when Apple takes you up the ladder  to buy their most expensive product or how you always say the iPad needs a better software and the M4 chip is too much for the iPad or that nobody asked for a thinner iPad when it could have had a bigger battery. These are the complaints you never stop talking about or at least these what I could recall and finally when you had the chance to confront THE CEO OF APPLE about these issues you freakin asked him to rank products ?? What’s wrong with your mind ?"
"Dammit Marques, as if Apple needs more customers. lol"
Siri and Apple cars are his best products!
"You can have money talk and how to suck money from customers with the cook, not tech talk! He Fckd the company and products. Integrating with open AI and calling it Apple intelligence shows his capabilities. Company with more than 2Trillion market cap can&#39;t do their own model, they rely on others like a small AI startup!"
touch computing should be the standard way. they wanted to protect notebooks
It would have been really badass if Marques had &#39;accidentally&#39; pulled out his main Android phone instead of his iPhone.
"This is crazy! Now apple own my soul . Now thru giving all the stuff i need in a phone . I mean think about it folks, your phone knows you more than yourself and your family. Now adding Ai ontop of it, it’s game set match .. 😂 I can’t believe I say the word soul."
Couple of difficult questions there! Good job.
Most NPC interview ever lol nothing new
Definitely needs 1.25x playback speed 😢
I really like the ease of scrolling pages with Magic Mouse. Thank you Tim.
Nah pulling a blind ranking to the CEO of Apple is insane 💀😭
I love the reaction when he ask about Vision Pro 🤣
"Magic mouse and ergonomics in one sentence - it made me laugh a lot. I haven&#39;t seen a much more unergonomic mouse in my life, but I&#39;ve seen and used it a lot."
"I hoped that you ask him, why the normal iPhone 15 isn&#39;t capable of AI."
The last point with his parents hit me 😭😭
Tim flexing all his rings all being closed
It is moments like these when you miss Steve Jobs the most<br>…and also petty stuff like having a vision &amp; passion about the company
He’s so slimy
thanks
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=743"">12:23</a> LMAOOOOOO Marques trying not to break"
"Loved to hear, that Tim Cook personally reviews apps on Vision Pro."
magic mouse = bar of soap
MKBHD Made him say AI too many times. Finally.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=391"">6:31</a> this is so fucking dumb. You are forcing people to accept a policy to use a service."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=168"">2:48</a> that is not a satisfying answer."
pride socks lol
Why does this sound like a keynote?
"if TIm Cook really means the thing about Apple not being motivated by people spending their lives on their devices, then bring back the iPhone Mini. AI and Siri can do the heavy lifting, so the big screen won&#39;t be as necessary."
"i actually love the Magic Mouse. i&#39;ve been using it for years and got no problems with it, not even that it charges upside down by the lighting cable i do that at night before going to sleep when i get a notification of low battery ( which lasts forever )"
Magic mouse.<br>Me: charging cable.
"My Blind rating came out like this because I didn’t want to give anything 1st place. Realistically, I feel Vision Pro isn’t the best of these… yet.<br><br>1 Vision Pro<br>2 MacBook Air<br>3 iPad<br>4 iPhone<br>5 Magic Mouse"
"90% of the comments: something something Magic Mouse. lawl.<br>10% of the comments: Marques&#39; interview game is pretty sic though, right??😄"
"It is funny seeing Tim Cook talk about a product that flopped and describe it as incredible, sad to see that he Apple never will actually admit that the product is not optimal or something"
more like tim cooked
Charging the magic mouse from the bottom eliminates any positives. So dumb.
Work hard till Tim Cook consider sitting with you !
Of course Tim Cook wouldn’t rank his own products 😂
Tim could have just admitted the Magic Mouse needs updating.
Mkbhd is not making to wwdc next year 💀
Apple is dead.
Hard to get him off the talking points shareholders have to hear. But some personal cracks were  brought out. Should have focused more on him but it was an important and balanced interview. It bridges the generational divide. Hats off to Tim.
“The magic mouse…” <br><br>“New number who dis?”
What a cop out! No blind ranking!
"Marques, it would be so badass if you read questions to Tim Cook from a Pixel 8 Pro!  :)"
"Wow, Tim off-script is a snooze-fest. zzzzZZZZZZ"
hahahaha magic mouse moment was great.
"Employees accuse Apple of donating to groups funding West Bank settlements,if this is true, we all should leave apple. As much as i like apple, im not supporting people that support the bad guys"
"This was probably one of the most awkward interviews I’ve seen, apart from the fight for no10 debate"
I find Tim&#39;s voice to be calming....I&#39;m an android fan tho 😅😊
After this interview they are for sure changing the magic mouse... Magic mouse pro or somethimg
Mentioning his deceased parents as a plug for the vision pro is next level robot
Interesting how he mentioned &quot;ergonomics&quot; when talking about the magic mouse. The design of that mouse is horrible for ergonomics. It&#39;s possibly the worst mouse you can buy.
I cant be the only one who absolutely loves the apple mouse? Besides the charging port its so easy to use
"I love MKBHD, but not in this capacity. Not a great interview IMO"
You gotta give it to Tim Cook. He&#39;s trying so hard to look and behave like a human being.
great job of not answering any of the questions at all tim
Tim didn’t even know what a Magic Mouse was.
bro that last &quot;game&quot; had 0 answer and it was so stupid
I love how editing got serious when he started talking about magic mouse 😂
"I’m blind, deaf and mute… How will this AI help me access and enjoy Xvideos?"
I love how Marques used s24 for the last recap video and now has an iphone 15pm
Am I the only one thinking no way he closed all his Apple Watch  rings ? (T. Cook) 😂
"Tim Cook finally gets the opportunity to talk to the most powerful man in tech, MKBHD."
"Did he say &quot;I lost both of my parrots&quot;? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=951"">15:51</a>"
Wait isn’t the Magic Mouse good? Why’s everyone hating on it?
Still waiting for the rankings....
bro is not making to wwdc 2025 😆
"When Tim Cook gives your 20 minutes of his time on a public platform, you know you are part of the Globalist machine. Congrats (I guess) on reaching new heights Mr. Brownlee."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=564"">9:24</a> &quot;I never look back darling, it distracts from the now&quot; - Edna Mode"
Lol the Magic Mouse&#39;s answer.
"This interview felt really weird - atleast compared to Nilay&#39;s with Sundar. While the latter was hard hitting, and had a good flow..This has some awkward pauses. <br>It seems to me like Marques was told to &quot;go easy&quot; on Tim Cook <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
"look at marques man, so inspirational"
i cannot comprehend why marcus didnt let Tim say goodmorning for us
Marques is definitely a great interviewer.
"Lets not forget, Tim/Apple wouldnt let Jon Stewart talk about AI on his Apple TV show as it would call out this company."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> mkbhd face 😆magic mousse...I saw what you did there 😆"
There are no people like Jony Ive and Steve Jobs in Apple today. That&#39;s why Androide has to be copied.
Tim: Hmmm what iphone model is that hmmm🥴 they all look the same<br><br>Marques: its 15 tim 🤭
"I always wonder if you&#39;ve ever asked Tim about a few features, you&#39;d like to see on apple devices, that you&#39;ve seen on others"
heard the lie of privacy - i&#39;m out... fuck propaganda...
I didn&#39;t know Riley&#39;s impression of him was THIS good
thx
"Thank you very much, Tim Apple"
Tim Cook carrying Apple&#39;s coffin to the cemetery
"I hope after the moment at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=741"">12:21</a> we will have a new magic mouse that actually not a pain to use"
hmm. now there will be a magic mouse pro
"Gotta respect the editing decisions with the magic mouse moment, there were no jokes said, but it was so funny"
This man is chattin
I have zero faith that he is gonna ask any pressing questions. Marques has been more critical about Apple products recently which i am a happy about but maybe ill get through this video and be suprised by this being an actual interview or discussion.
When we getting a full length podcast with these two?
Is it just me or others also feel that Tim is more of an administrator than an inspiring CEO?
"I started to watch but then, I cannot bother."
Tim want all the people see him like Marques does 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=870"">14:30</a> bro got tensed. I use it for ehh.. seats up* lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> Tim struggling to recognize which iPhone model MKBHD has."
It&#39;s fascinating to hear him talk about the potential future of using phones less due to the advancement of Intelligence. Looking forward to Apple&#39;s next big move.
What do you use Vision Pro ? All Tim could think of was viewing spatial photos?
Imagine marques using his s24 ultra infront of tim 😂
"I honestly think the magic mouse is better than most mice (as a trackball user lol), but i still found that short conversation about the magic mouse and marques reaction to tim so hilarious 🎉😂"
ergonomic
magic mouse would be ergo if we have fins
CEOs really do have very high listening skills. They hear even the smallest comment.
this guy can really talk about a bunch of nothing for a while
Why does cook sound so ingenuine or is it just me?
"I am waiting him to drop the bomb, why iPad  doesnt run mac OS or why we need to charge the magic mouse in an awkward position?"
Tim cooked 🔥
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> don&#39;t know why Marques saying 15 cracked me up so much 😂😂"
"Maybe you can convince Apple to make some way to automate backing up iCloud content locally instead of having to synchronize everything locally first, and then back it up from there.<br><br>Would be so nice to have it built in as an option in Time Machine, or even better a Photos file provider api so other could utilize it as well."
"Jesus, the Magic Mouse. I could feel the lack of comfort."
CEO 2nd most valuable company in the world<br>Doesn&#39;t know how ranking works
This Tim Cook guy was lucky if this event was bad mkbhd gonna bankrupt this company too
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=759"">12:39</a> The Magic Mouse Ergonomics... 🤔"
"Please try to be honest Tim Cook just for once, and admit that the Magic Mouse is a terrible product you’ve have forgotten 😂"
Wow Tim really blowing up. Made it on MKBHD. Been following his small company for a while now. 🤯
Tim Cook more like Tim Zuckerberg
"Privacy standards <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=308"">5:08</a>"
"I hope the soon try a different approach to interviews were they actually can say what they think and want. You can just feel like they are thinking so hard to give an “apple interview” where everything has to be positive and use big word like, “huge” and “incredible” etc."
Their channels have the same amount of followers 😂
Interesting - i think Apple has an ai hardware issue 🤔 I understand that Apple has taken a certain route with AI to be on device but his answer doges the fact that they haven’t gone out and produced anything within the generative ai space that is truly great. They clearly are not in competition with foundation model creators. I think they are doing this perhaps due to lack of compute. NVIDIA isn’t physically able to make enough chips to have apple dominate and future batches are spoken for. OpenAI/Microsoft and Meta have grabbed majority share.
Tim Cook is one of the greatest CEOs of all time. I love seeing that he&#39;s had such success without being comfortable on camera. Much respect.
"Marques is such a SARCISTIC being ngl, see the smirk 😂"
You know you’ve made it when you’re interviewing Tim Cook for YouTube.
"Well played, Marques. You&#39;ve certainly found a way to compel Apple to either update or discontinue their problematic Magic Mouse."
That smerk you did. when he looked at your phone and it wasn’t an iPhone
"Here&#39;s a hot take on the Magic Mouse: as a person with giant gorilla hands for whom no mouse is &quot;ergonomic&quot; or remarkably comfortable to use the Magic Mouse is about as good as anything. The charging situation is kinda janky, but the seamless integration makes up for that. It could be better, but it&#39;s not all that bad."
Next step? Talk with Elon Musk?
"Tim literally doesn&#39;t know what Magic Mouse is and just made that one up, not surprised to be honest. Only time I hear it is when Marques talks about it :)"
"Damn, the first half of the interview I thought &quot;okay, Tim Cook seems like a proper interesting and honest guy when not doing the marketing stuff&quot;, but as soon as Marques starts the blind ranking game, I go back to seeing how full of sh... Apple and the management is... I mean, he didn&#39;t even actually participate in the game, he just decides to talk about their products like he&#39;s on another keynote speech. And I was almost sold. Thanks Marques for shining the light for us to see the reality."
"Your microphones have comb filtering, might want to check mic placement or that there are not 2 mics picking up the sound"
"&quot;our objective is never to be the first, our objective is to be the best&quot; yep"
my hot take is that the Apple Magic Mouse is actually very comfortable
Ask Dan Ives. He seems to know more than Tim Cook 😂
Tim Cook is underrated. He is obviously extremely passionate and deserves more credit
"Is it safe to assume that Tim is just the face of Apple? He doesn’t seem to know much about Apple, no passion about the company and its products!"
"well, nothing actually said here..."
Bro had to check to be sure it was an iphone 🤣
Did he mention that it will likely be cause human extinction because they are oppressed heartless killing machines?
Time really knows how to answer without actually answering
He is absolutely boring.
"dang, you REALLY caught him off guard with the magic mouse… he seemed to forget what it was for a good 10 seconds 😂"
This is a good one
Such a well done interview just finished watching it
Bro he just left Tim Cook in an emotional mangle lmfaoo
What is bro yapping about
I must be one of the few people who doesn’t care about privacy. I have nothing to hide and I appreciate customized experiences
"Goodness gracious, heavens above, well I&#39;ll be darned, wow, would you look at that, wow, now isn&#39;t that something truly wow remarkable and astonishing, oh my stars and garters, wow!"
Wow
multiple WINDOWS
he done did sign with apple
Just a huge pile of word salad.
It’s nice listening to Tim talking not following a script
"Tim falsely claiming how incredible the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse are just shows how incredibly out of touch he and Apple are with reality. Unfortunate that Marques didn&#39;t bring up right-to-repair to really put Tim in an uncomfortable position, but very happy our boi still got to sit down with one of the worst elite billionaires on the planet."
Idk about executing haha. Siri has been completely smoked.
"If he is not paid for this video, you can call me Barbie."
Tim&#39;s reaction when he heard about apple mouse🤣
"I loved that Marques had to subtly say out loud “the Magic Mouse?”, just to make sure that he and Tim were actually talking about the same product and Tim hadn’t just misheard him. 😅"
Imagine he interviewed him while using a samsung.
"The level of both the questions and the answers is really awe inspiring. As a French person, I nearly can&#39;t believe my ears. It&#39;s very refreshing to see that at least somewhere in the world, this level is achieved. Congrats!"
Is it just me anyone can hear the buzzing sound in the background. It&#39;s annoying
We need a real smart watch with siri and M1 chip. And smart earrings. Smartphone will die soon.
"tim cook is so media trained, this interview of him is so well-rounded, which translate to boring. (not Marques&#39; problem when it comes to interviewing)"
yes...incredible things....watching tik-tok...
Marques making videos like &quot;dear apple&quot; and then when he gets the opportunity to actually talk to the person responsible for all the bad decisions he barks when Tim tells him too. What a waste of time this video was.
Looking forward to adopting the features already available in other devices for ages. Like home screen customization 🤣 seriously!
I don&#39;t know why but listening to Tim Cook reminds me of Jack Barker from Silicon Valley.
AI cannot be off the table because the Street is looking for the companies to have AI solutions that actually work and as an active offering.
"Tim really doesn&#39;t seem to know that much, felt like a lot of the answers was just him rambling to say something and didn&#39;t even make much sense for half the responses"
"I liked the way Tim couldnt identify which Iphone Marquous was having. At the same time he wanted to avoid acknowledging iPhone 15, 14 and 13 are all same."
"Tim &quot;The Toolman&quot; Apple, lol. Because he is a tool!"
Why is ur watch on ur right arm?
Talking about the magic mouse without mentioning the lighting port is nuts
I just loved the SLOW ZOOM IN when Tim talks about &quot;ERGONOMICS&quot; for the magic mouse 😂😂😂😂
"🤣🤣 MKBHD put that magic mouse there on purpose.. you can&#39;t tell me otherwise 😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a>"
"The magic mouse is the worst mouse I have ever used in terms of &quot;ergonomics&quot;. Marques&#39; face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> speaks volumes."
"Man, I hope you stop yourself from time to time, check out the view where you’re at, and feel grateful for it! I bet you probably do, because I felt I could detect at least a hint of giddiness from you in this video. It’s really special these kinds of experiences, and I hope you don’t ever take them for granted! Keep killing it man, all the success is well deserved!"
I wish he had pushed a bit harder on the blind ranking. Always interesting to hear Tim&#39;s &quot;personal&quot; take.
"AI can save apple on money, just say that Tim. No need to beat around the bush"
Tim cook&#39;s accent kinda sounds like technoblades dad
this integrated AI sounds like a massive privacy infringement
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=320"">5:20</a> I was afraid it was his Galaxy <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
Marques should be considered for next Apple CEO!
bro set him up with the magic mouse and almost broke the character lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=875"">14:35</a> Tim’s expression while answering about Apple Vision Pro. He’s himself clearly struggling to find a suitable use case for it 😅"
&quot;I never look back.&quot;<br>5 min later<br>&quot;Yeah so I spend hours looking at 3D reconstructions of my parents alone in my VR headset.&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=179"">2:59</a> Bringing an iPhone for the interview with Tim Cook is a nice touch."
I love Tim struggling to say anything good about the Magic Mouse and then mentioning the ergonomics as the key feature of the least ergonomic mouse in the world. 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> Sad that Tim can&#39;t instantly identify the phone"
Love that Marques is not using is S24 Ultra during this Interview 😆
Okay but the words &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; and &#39;ergonomics&#39; shouldn&#39;t belong in the same sentence 😅
"Should have asked Tim how he feels that all Apple devices are, at the core, made off the backs of Congolese children, men, and women who are mining resources with their bare hands and who are treated terribly at the cost of these products."
"I do not think people have yet grasped how life changing Apple Vision will be. Mostly, due to the cost, the masses have not experienced it yet. But I can envision Apple Vision in a light weight more affordable aspect replacing everything Apple. Give it time! Cool interview"
Magic mouse was and still is an atrocious piece of &quot;tech&quot;
That was a really great interview!
So the CEO doesn’t use Vision Pro or Magic Mouse all that much ✅
Did Tim Cook even rank one of the products discussed during the blind ranking?
Elon Musk has already begun spreading misinformation over Twitter probably because of envy
"Hearing Tim say &quot;generative AI&quot; felt so relieving unlike when watching the Google Gemini event where their clear intention is to make their users blind and dump and let their gadgets do everything in their lives. Sometimes, not going all out is a better decision."
"Emmm, when tim answer marques&#39; question in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">5:30</a>, tim even couldn&#39;t tell which gen of iPhone that marques using... well because they&#39;re all the SAME! I think maybe that&#39;s why marques giggles lol"
I really was waiting for Marques to ask why the charging port is at the bottom of the mouse.
I love Tim Cook&#39;s socks 😂
Tim: we don’t think about the past<br>Also Tim: here’s my photographic memory of everything that’s every happened at Apple
"On Mr. Cook’s legacy. Taking over after Steve Jobs was a daunting, even superhuman task, and there were loads of doubters and haters. Building Apple into a three trillion dollar company is an extraordinary achievement by Mr. Cook as CEO, and by scores of people around him. In my view, that’s just an undeniable fact. Getting there, however, Apple showed an absolutely unseemly deference to the CCP and president Xi. For the benefit of the Apple shareholders, Mr. Cook became Uncle Tim."
"Next time you sit down with him, ask him to bring back iPhone mini"
Hats off to Marques for his fantastic interviewing skills. His questions brought out some crucial aspects of AI development and privacy considerations.
I think the iPad calculator deserves a special introduction
Our objective is not to be the first<br>Our objective is to be the best❤
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=584"">9:44</a> Steve Wozniak for example"
"Dude, I can&#39;t believe just looking at the growth from 10+ years of MKBHD.  Like, the thoughts were never *bad*.  The freaking refinement of everything, from Marques being so damn articulate, and a true expert of the tech sector, and sitting down to have this kind of conversation in a way that doesn&#39;t get overshadowed by a CEO&#39;s presence, it&#39;s just damn cool.  So much respect....also I feel old as hell now."
"am i dumb? or tim starts talking nonsense from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=322"">5:22</a> &quot;we&#39;re utilizing the same silicon, or not the same silicon&quot;?"
I was like wow what an honest and nice guy.. then he tried to sell the magic mouse on ergonomics
Tim Cook at 2x takes a few of the years away.
What&#39;d be great would be Louis Rossman interviewing Tim
"when I grip the mic, it&#39;s like I&#39;m lookin&#39; through the face of God<br>I can&#39;t even begin to understand why I&#39;m so hot<br>Did everything I could to fit in, man, I really tried<br>But was crucified"
SHOUT OUT TO MY BOI MARK ASS BROWN LEE
ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaa😂😂🎉
Marques threw in a doozy with the magic mouse lol.
LeTIMCOOK

Lots of wood behind that arrow of an interview…
Bro did Tim dirty slipping in the magic mouse
The word &#39;Magic mouse&#39; and &#39;Ergonomics&#39; should not coexist🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Tim: &quot;We always talk about the benefit to the user&quot;<br>Also Tim: proceeds to make repairs unnecessarily difficult and introduces component pairing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> is crazy lol"
Magic Trackpad replaced my Magic Mouse years ago...... so much better
"that is one OLD DUDE, avoiding almost every direct question and answering with pre-dictated answers..."
Nice socks Tim!
"I&#39;m not an Apple fan, in fact the last Apple device I owned was the original iPod touch. However, I have to applaud Cook here. Not only is it very brave for a CEO to take questions from a YouTuber, (that don&#39;t seem to have been pre-planned), but he also really showed that he knows his stuff. It sounds obvious, but not many tech CEO&#39;s talk with as much authority on their actual tech as he is doing here."
Sneaky Marquez 😉<br>Guess we’re getting a Magic Mouse update now 😇<br>Wouldn’t surprise me that much
"“Apple Intelligence” Would be Worse than “Facebook &amp; TikTok” Combine. Chat GPT Would be INSIDE YOUR PHONE, Sharing ALL DATA with “Apple &amp; Microsoft” E-mails- Photos-Videos- CONTACTS- WALLETS ( CREDIT CARDS ) PASSWORDS- DON’T INSTALL iOS18<br>Be Safe Be Smart with Your PRIVACY. DON’T BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING YOU HEAR. “WE CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY”"
12:4 he wants to laugh 😂
the least inspiring Top Dog ever.
"apple is going queer full speed, after Sonoma, their next macOS will be called Sodoma"
Love how most of his answers are non-answers. Checks out w/ the typical Apple user. Makes sense the guy in charge is the same way
anyone else just hear tree trunks
I wonder if he&#39;s like this in casual conversations with friends. Can he not be so carefully constructed? Does he have friends?
useless
everything changed everything
Tim admitting they could have improved the mouse would have given him a lot more PR than lying his ass off saying it is ergonomic
At 12.26 MKBHD realising I’m not gonna get anything from Timmy
pathetic that this guy got most of his views from trashing a start up car company now he is back to apple and phones would be hilarious and ironic if apple buy fisker
Tim knows how to curve an answer boy 😂
Tim is AI trained?
We love Apple we love Tim❤️
"Let’s be real, we watched this for an insight of Tim Cook, not Apple."
"Is he gay, i feel like his words are... flirty"
Funny that even Tim couldn’t tell what Iphone that was😂😂😂
"Bad interview. We learned nothing about what is Tim&#39;s vision about Apple future and the future of technology itself. Asking about the Magic Mouse was stupid move. Tim obviously didn&#39;t like it, and you lost the opportunity to interview him again in the future."
Tim is cooked by his statement about  &quot;ergonomics&quot; for the mouse.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> MKBHD clarifying to Tim that it&#39;s iPhone 15 establishes the fact all iphones look the same and even the father couldn&#39;t identify his children."
Pretty tame interview... i guess it had to be or you wouldn&#39;t have gotten the interview otherwise.
even Tim struggled to talk about magic mouse😭
Missed his shot to be an actual real human being with the magic mouse comment and essentially invalidated everything else he said. All PR shilling.
It’s important to remember when listening to an Apple representative that this is the same company that effectively uses slaves to create their product and is incredibly wasteful with their product design to force the consumer base to keep bring new product.
"I Heard Magic mouse and Ergonomics, I came to the comments."
pretty not great interview
where is marques google pixel ?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=240"">04:00</a> „We already view privacy as a fundamental human right“, at least as long as it’s not the China that want to take privacy away from their in country users"
MKBHD always asks the right questions. Great interview.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=126"">2:06</a> Inni di bininging"
Magic Mouse segment was seriously awkward for both of you 😅
"Great interview, I like the fact that you didn’t push for the blind ranking…I don’t think he understood your request 🥰"
"Solid interview Marques. Asked him some solid direction questions. Like all CEO’s he danced around a few of them masterfully, but overall this was insightful."
PLAY THE GAME TIM!!!
Why does it look like team apple support mkhd and team Android supports Arun 😂😂
"Not gonna lie, not very interesting takes"
"I’d love a Magic Mouse with the new MacBook design language. Elevate the base, get rid of the tapered edges (make it boxy like the OG first gen mouse), and keep the top glass with multi touch support."
Magic Mouse &quot;an incredible moment&quot; is hilarious
Talking Tech and Apple Intelligence with Tim Cook!
"Brilliant an official statement saying their objective is never to be first, but best. Explains why they’re so behind the times on technology. Doesn’t feel to me like that’s what Steve Jobs wanted. So many original ahead of its time and trend setting devices back then and now everything the same and 15 years behind current day’s technology"
That face when &quot;Ergonomics&quot; is mentioned about the magic mouse
Nice try with the ranking exercise and getting a reaction on the mouse and vision pro.<br>Interviewing still not MKBHD&#39;s strength though.
the zoom when he brought up the magic mouse was perfect 😆
i think about the magic mouse charging port...they just do it intentionally to make sure no wire messing up when we using it...if u wanna use it charge it first
Are you getting invited back after that Magic Mouse moment? :) honest question… did you get feedback from their PR people… ?
PCC someone should answer  That 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> marques face when Tim said &quot;getting the ergonomics right for the magic mouse was key&quot; I&#39;m dyinggg"
"We need a better ergonomics magic mouse, or just give the option of receiving a logitech 502 mouse"
Talking softball
Marques didn’t dare to bring his favorite Samsung to the interview with Tim 😂
Apple Intelligence (A.I.) these mf smart af
"“I always look at the front, not at the rear mirror”<br>10 mins later:<br>“I lost both of my parents and being able to see things differently…”"
"I like how he asked direct and honest questions that he really wanted to know, instead of asking the same boring questions everyone else in interviews do"
Can we notice that none of them drank any water from the water bottles on the side of each of them?
Well that was a sparky interview
his name is time apple
"What about right to repair?  Come on Apple.  Allow board level repair via replacing chips, with schematics released.  Let the customer choose who can repair the Apple device they bought."
Good conversation between Marques and Tim 👏🏻
Why does every old guy have to wear white Nikes?
Apple bought Marcus😢

Talk about the new update in apple that&#39;s a 10/0 in samsung
Magic Mouse. I see what you did there. 😂
"The moment when Tim didn&#39;t recognize which iPhone model MKBHD has, as all the models are just same. :P"
There is some weird background white noise in this video that confuses a bit while watching
The magic mouse moment and Marques’ face… 😂
Magic mouse is shit
At least Tim is accepting outside of the keynote that its AI and not Apple Intelligence
Tim: &quot;It became clear that like always we&#39;re falling behind so we outsourced the thing we&#39;re really bad at as opposed to just acceptably bad at&quot;<br>The implementation of generative AI 😂 basically copy what other companies have already done and it makes our software suite look true to form (bad).<br><br>Apple forever catching up to last year / decade&#39;s technology.<br><br>Dude didn&#39;t understand blind ranking even after the idea was explained to him.  Definitely from product management / sales.
Timmy
"Man, this was a masterclass in vagueness. It felt as if Tim was way too overly cautious in his answers."
"Too bad they couldn&#39;t use &quot;Apple Intel&quot; as the brand; it sounds way cooler than &quot;Apple Intelligence,&quot; but it would have confused a lot of people."
There is a slight noise in the background. Just highlighting so you can get rid of it next time and continue delivering content of top class.

Good interview! So cool you were able to get it!
"the fact that he&#39;s unable to be speak critically even about something as bad as the magic mouse makes him loose the credibility around all his other selling points. Marques went easy on him by talking about a product that&#39;s easy to criticise without hurting the company, yet he still couldn&#39;t do it, he left that low hanging fruit hanging"

"I wish you hadn&#39;t probed Tim to answer the first question in a certain way. I say this because you already gave Tim an answer while you posed the question! But other than that, a great fireside chat with Tim! 🙌🚀"
Gross
The most meaningful sentence is that apple will not upload the data to OpenAI.
Tbh even if he hates magic mouse he just cant say that
vision pro summon dead people?
This bloke has clearly never used the magic mouse for more than 1 minute
Marques&#39; face when Tim Cook mentioned Magic Mouse and Ergonomics in same sentence. :D
"I wish Apple would make it easier to develop apps on it. It would be great if users could build their own apps and have them on their phones, developing a citizen developer community. Currently  you have to pay Apple $99 to be able to put your own app on your own phone."
"Would have loved to see some sort of interrogation towards what models are used for the GenAI models, which artists are being stolen from to what degree to put Image Playground on every tech-illiterate grandma’s iMessage bar. For a company that was long held as being for creatives, it’s a giant slap in the face."
&quot;You decide&quot; is something I never thought I would hear Timmy say.
Tim didn&#39;t recognized his newest product at first glance XD
Sorry for saying this but this has been a wasted opportunity for asking Tim some though quenstions instad of the questions that have apprently been scripted by Apple&#39;s PR people.
rip
The subtle editing during the &quot;Magic mouse&quot; part deserves an award. Marques has to ensure that it&#39;s not overdone so that he will still get an invitation to WWDC2025.
It interesting how people on such a high level have such a difference perspective and way of thinking. Great interview!
Tim please give us Polish Siri!
Marques does an interesting thing where he doesn&#39;t look Tim in the eyes.  I wonder why.
MKBHD is turning annoying with these cheap gotchas and recent clickbait video titles
Marcus smirking when he said &quot;ergonomics of the magic mouse&quot; fully smelling the BS. haha
I love how every comment is about Tim complimenting the Magic Mouse
Should have asked why serial matching hardware is a thing as it has nothing to do with durability or repairability.
lmao not Marques hides away his samsung during this interview
OMG you have arrived...I can see how excited you are in your eyes. You keep it together well.  Great interview.
Steve Jobs this man is not.
People were scared to death of AI and now they can&#39;t shut up about it 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️
"Marques just holding his laughter inside when tim mentions ergonomic design of magic mouse is hilarious🤣🤣 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a>"
Marques set this up really cleverly and exposed Cook. How much can you trust a man regarding your privacy who at the same time praises Magic Mouse for it&#39;s ergonomics? Clearly this man is a bullshitter and will spout anything regardless of reality
"I hope Apple does good as a company, the start up looks promising."
"MKBHD is no good interviewer - he&#39;s way to shy and let&#39;s say submissive. Why didn&#39;t he say straight forward that the magic mouse has by far the worst ergonomics in the whole industry? .... the same with the calculator in the talk with craig. Why didnt apple just let us use the standard calc until they update it to the now presented one? ... this is ridiculous by apple and MKBHD is to afraid to tell them.<br><br>I think you should have the courage to say whats wrong if you&#39;re such a big tech youtuber and especially if you&#39;re critizing the products in your regular videos. If not, it&#39;s just cheap marketing for Apple in your &quot;interviews&quot;..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=161"">2:41</a> yes but why did you call it that?"
He&#39;s totally fake and using mkbhds platform to market using the same tagline they used in a product launching what a BS
I guess Elon may not accept it by talking. He will need something to prove that the AI will not do something about privacy.
Yeah go forward and don’t give sh*t about old devices!
Noticed that Marques is using his apple products. And that him and tim are wearing the apple watch towards the camera. Hmmm. More apple advertising tricks.
"Such a hard thing must be to be a tech reviewer and strike that balance so apple actually invites you to talk to them in person. <br>Can&#39;t be too critical, but also can&#39;t be too kiss ass or you lose your audience."
&quot;Wood behind the arrow&quot;. Not a baseball reference. Not a steam engine technology reference..... An ancient technology reference with regard to effort put into privacy. Interesting.
Congratulations on your 19M sub! 🎉
"I personally think a majority of people would still use their screens alot, even if the ai was perfect. <br><br>Ai can replace tasks sure, but it can&#39;t watch my shows for me, nuh uh. 😂 And none of that &quot;Hey Siri, watch every episode of One Piece and then send it to Neuralink.&quot; <br><br>Bro that would probably kill someone."
But if you don&#39;t remember where you came from how do you avoid making previous mistakes?
My boy MKBHD is a bit darker than I am used to him
❤ I wish if there was a question on the iPadOS roadmap ?! 😅
Tl;dr - corpo-speak
"&#39;Cmon guys, I am not THAT influential in tech world!&#39;"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=203"">3:23</a> How is the thoughtful and privacy first approach to put it in all the apps you rely on? That just means you can&#39;t avoid it. <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=315"">5:15</a> the only problem this slightly helps with is supply chain attacks. It still sends private data to someone else&#39;s computer."
I wonder if Tim Cook or anyone at Apple has watched MKBHD’S reviews on Apple products and then talk to each other about it
Great interview! Well thought out questions and dialog!
Magic Mouse is great. Tim Cook is so boring.
Close up on M’s face when TC said “getting the ergonomics right” on magic mouse 😂😂😂
goog good :)
Bro brought his iphone because of the interview😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> - My absolute favorite part of this video. Marques keeping a straight face.. 🤣"
Who added that zoom when they were talking about the Magic Mouse? 😂
"“We believe…”, “we feel…” means he can’t be held accountable if it turns out AI isn’t as private or safe as it should be."
Should’ve asked about the iPod… such a great device to disconnect yourself from the world
Such an un inspiring CEO.
"this powwow really sounds like Negan was standing behind the camera with Lucille, making sure that everything is kosher"
Imagine if MKBHD actually pulled up with an s24 ultra at this meeting 😆
"so how much do y&#39;all think I had to do with pretty much everything and everyone in this vid? Including Dua? And you, in the beginning. Ur missing out on the greatest story ever. And one more thing, I don&#39;t think you are a bad person, so I invite you to walk a while in my shoes and ponder on how fair it has all been ..."
Yap city
How much part was cut <br>I wanna know 🤔
Marcus just nailed it with the BLIND RANKING 😂😂
Lmao Tim didn’t really answer any of these questions properly<br>Just dodged them like most CEOs<br>The Magic Mouse bit was funny <br>Good questions though
&quot;We had to get Magic Mouse ergonomics correct.&quot;<br><br>You didn&#39;t succeed. Literally nobody I know uses it as their work mouse. It&#39;s Logitech MX3 (or equivalent) all around me.
marques using an iphone instead of samsung so tim does not kill him
Tim is looking pretty ripped! Good for him to get on some strength training 💪
"Can this people just be normal without all this PR stuff, why is ergonomics being mentioned in the same line with the magic mouse"
Apple under SJ made so many world changing devices with so much less resources than they have now... Did innovation die?<br><br>&quot;A legacy is defined by people looking at you not something you define yourself&quot; Tim Cook
is the video recorded by iphone? 💀💀
What a great interview with two people who are so passionate about their professions.
"As bad as it is, I love my Magic Mouse. 😂"
magic mouse is not ergonomic. there. same sentence.
Tim Cook trying to be like Jon Prosser 😂
I love how Marques is subtly placing the Pixel term &quot;feature drops&quot; at the end of the interview :-)
MKBHD trying to influence Tim to really consider updating the Magic Mouse… 😂
"Magic mouse ,,😂😂 even Tim was like ,,WTF is he serious 😂😂😂"
The Magic Mouse part was hilarious
Tim Apple!
Congrats for having this kind of interview. But this showcases that Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs.
He really does talk like in their videos/conferences
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=151"">2:31</a> By people, you mean shareholders right?"
"Tim is just avoiding all the questions, amazing to see such bull* in one place ahah"
"Ohhhhh he&#39;s talking about crash detection as in, getting hit by a car, not an app crashing because of a glitch"
The tittle of this video should have been &quot;Magic Mouse&quot;.😅
How to lie in apple way.. he couldnt rate his product.. atleast admit magic mouse was a shitshow
Ask the guy why couldn&#39;t they make a LLM like chatgpt yet? Maybe he answered it by saying their objective is never to the first.... But still would be nice to infer what advantage Openai has over Apple at the moment from the horse mouth.
"Did you read Tim&#39;s body language? You can almost taste the pressure, a mix of stress, discomfort, and frustration but also a good control over all of it."
Gotta hand it to Apple for how they keep to their philosophy
"To be fair, Tim did not say they got the ergonomics right. He only said it was key. 😂"
Tim can&#39;t admit they were pushed by other competitors to bring AI in their lineups.
Tim gave the lamest beat around the bush answers. I hate seeing interviews with CEOs they cant and wont say anything truly of note
your composure to maintain straight face during Magic Mouse discussion is nothing short of amazing
What a waffler he is.
"Tim Cook seemed to get emotional about being able to view his parents in Vision Pro, very true fr"
Interview with Apple executives - always cringeworthy
The Magic Mouse is apparently Apple&#39;s most ergonomic design guys!
Seeing billionaires in an awkward position is so funny to me.  Marquis you’re a bad ass 😂😂
Marques inside voice was screaming &quot;STOP THE CAP🧢!!!&quot; As Cook was trying so hard to praise the magic mouse 🤣🤣
Nobody saying anything about Marques switching back to iPhone for his notes in this interview? ;)
the tier list was a horrible interview idea
“The first one it wasn’t about how many people would buy it. It was about establishing foundation.”<br><br>Sounds like an apology for Vision Pro
Haha... MKMHD was so totally un convinced when Tim Cook said their model does not need information to succeed.
"On Magic Mouse: Tim missed the perfect opportunity to simply say &quot;5, NEXT!&quot; and earn a ton of respect. Instead, he showed you the salesman he really is. I&#39;m convinced this man knows nothing of the reputation of the magic mouse. Kudos to MKBHD for not bursting out in laughter after Cook says &quot;It was also an incredible moment.&quot; when he realized this billionaire sitting in front of him is clueless."
"Tim kind of sounds like Forrest Gump when he talks I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s a Southerner thing but it makes me like him more, as thought I know him personally"
"&quot;It wasn&#39;t about how many people would buy it, it was about establishing the foundation&quot; 🤣🤣 This man is just trying to set the premise as an excuse for the Apple Vision Pro. The Air was totally about how many people would buy it, as they said in their earnings calls back then. He&#39;s obviously just looking for an out to the shareholders regarding the vision pro."
"I hate to say it, because I don’t think brag I have the balls to ask hard hitting questions when I’m with people, but still….talking about the Magic Mouse without doing any follow up questions on why they don’t fix it? I’m sorry but this is one thing that makes me a little bit sad because I look so much up to you. I guess your only human after all, and I’ll always be your fan. But you can’t blame me for wishing that you would just turn up the pressure a little bit. Feels a bit like soft balls"
Marques asked the right questions ! He&#39;s very good at this kind of interview
Can we keep saying Apple Artificial Intelligence
I was hoping this interview would happen. Fabulous! Thanks MKBHD!
❤❤❤❤ i love you brown maq....
Ok that&#39;s why they had started copy to android
Not him stressing &quot;privacy&quot; as an important point while apple is working hand in hand with the chinese government to spy on their entire population<br>🤡
iPhone 15 pro or iPhone 15 pro max.? Which one should I get.? 🤔Today is the day so excited 🤙
Tim is seriously twisting answers 😭😂
"The whole interview was so interesting to watch but after the magic mouse, I can&#39;t anymore-"
"Private cloud means data sent to cloud provider still data will be vlunerable as other providers big AI models still will require more processing power , till cheap high power chip Ai models will require data to go private cloud or servers"
I&#39;m afraid this was the last time Marques interviewed someone from Apple.
Marques has come a long way...
The collab we have wanted
"Marques we saw what you did with the Magic Mouse question. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> 😂"
I thought that was Ellen
wish Marques used his S24u in front of tim
Would like to see a Daringfireball x MKBHD interview.
"every other product = good, no justification needed<br>vision pro = so my parents died"
Set the playback speed to 1.25x. You’ll thank me later 😉
i don&#39;t know if im stupid or i just didn&#39;t understand the interview..is tim extremely media trained skirting around topics giving somewhat vague answers..or half of the time he just don&#39;t know what to say
"so much said but still with no substance, real corporate talk."
I love how the S24 Ultra vanished for this interview 😂
"Come off as authentic he shouldn&#39;t have replied like that about the magic mouse, now we can&#39;t fully trust anything he says."
somehow this was painful to watch I dont know why
"&quot;Magic Mouse.&quot;... I see what you did there, I see you... 😆"
It would&#39;ve been rad if MKBHD had used S24 ultra in this video to check his questions/notes.
"You could have asked him about icar, if it is still in the pipeline"
"&quot;Our model isn&#39;t engagement&quot; No, it&#39;s selling devices. Devices which lock you into a system of always feeling the need to buy more of those devices. Not that that&#39;s bad per se but of course Apple ultimately doesn&#39;t care if you never look at your phone - it made its profit at point of sale. Meanwhile, nearly all other tech companies have a slightly more difficult balance of trying to either make money from providing a free service or making a profit on hardware that people don&#39;t feel anywhere near as loyal about.<br><br>And as for not actually ranking the products. Chicken."
"Could have been really interesting, but was really boring.<br><br>Mostly Tim’s fault because you could see he answered politically on everything basically<br><br>But marques could have made his life a bit harder ie questioning the ergonomics note on the magic mouse and not just move on…)"
World&#39;s best AI എവ്വാ .....🤷🏼‍♂️<br>Tim Annan ക്കി...... ജയ്..😁
"Tim after the interview: *asks employees what the hell is the Magic Mouse <br><br>Employees: *show Tim the mouse<br><br>Tim: damn, who designed this again?"
Gotta love how Marques threw in the Magic Mouse curve ball 😂😂😂
🙄 Prolly the richest scammer to ever exist 🙄
"Marques trying his hardest not to throw a Magic Mouse at Tim at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=746"">12:26</a> is absolutely hilarious! He may be the most unbiased and friendly reviewer in the game, but even this man has his limit with corporate BS!"
"oof that was awkward, MKBHD isn&#39;t in a position to speak his mind. And Tim Cook is on PR training max level. Nothing was really said here lol just a bunch of false pretenses"
Why did you do him like that 😂😂😂 Not the unmagic mouse bro 😅
Why not ask him about the iPad os to move to macOS 😂
"So proud of you Marques, been watching you since your first videos."
Throughout first 5 mins I honestly didn&#39;t catch any great points
AI tools would have remove the humming noise in this video before it was uploaded ;-)
After apple granting this privilege to Marques... does anyone think he will remain ABSOLUTELY impartial with Apple for the next products reviews?  ...are we sure?
With „ai for the rest of us“ they ment only for the rich one who can afford a 15 pro
"In my top ten I will put the iPhone at number 1 because everything that Apple has built nowadays it had been made for the iPhone (Apple silicon) and then the number 2 is macOS because all OS from Apple are based on macOS behind the scene with different a UI, and then the rest of products"
My one takeaway from this interview is that Tim Cook does <i>not</i> use a Vision Pro. <br><br>He just knows what the press release says about it.
Jokes aside from the Magic Mouse. I would love a Magic Mouse Pro with the form factor like a Logitec MX Master or something like that. Scrolling with my MX Master just does not feel right on Mac.
Magic Mouse &amp; Ergonomics lol. 😂 Loved the close up of Marques as the words cane out of Tim’s mouth. Props to the editor 🎉😂
Great sit down...
Ballsy move asking about the magic mouse
Tim is so careful with his answers. We need more direct questions like: Why is magic mouse so shit? Why is the mic on the iPad poorly placed?
"Мы хотим смотреть в будущее. <br>О а давайте вернем HDMI, SD Card, 😂"
Imagine if Marques had his Galaxy S24U out
Amazing
"“Our objective is not to be first, our objective is to be the best” fuck yeah Timmy boy"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> Marques is holding to not laugh :D"
can ya tell him to make apple products in a dark variant space grey space black i fucking hate the white colour!
What about Microsoft and Ai? Apple is again behind..
you should have pressured him into ranking the products. we need braver interviewers.
MKBHD is really top guy
"This man has insane shoes to fill and crazy pressure, he gets a lot of flack but this was a good interview."
Look the Magic Mouse isn’t that best and most ergonomic mouse but it has 100% because infamous wether good or bad.
Kill Bill sirens when talking about the Magic Mouse
"So, basically watching videos of Ceo&#39;s is useless, they say NOTHING"
"I can&#39;t take someone seriously that says magic mouse is ergonomic, even if they are god themselves"
I love Tim cook. Could watch these 2 talk for hours!
"Thr fact that this Tim cannot be honest about Apples worst product ever, and arguably one of the worst mouses out there. Makes me wonder what else he is not honest about...😢"
Tell what you learned from this interview and his answers. Nothing.
He absolutely did not want to play the blind ranking game :)) Too much PR training will bring the fun out of you
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a><br>Yeah, see Tim?<br>It <b>*is*</b> hard to distinguish the newer iPhones from the older ones."
Will the Data/Request sent to Open Ai (with Permission) go to apple&#39;s access as well?  (Important as they want to improve their own model in the future).
Bro met tim cook before gta 6
Tim sounds exactly like silicon valley’s Jack Barker. He nearly even mentioned the conjoined triangles of succes 😂
Great questions and interview!
"Apple branding AI as Apple Intelligence is the most Apple thing ever. Just like so many other marketing crap words like Private Cloud Compute. It is not more private if you name it private. You still have to trust a party, it just another computer you dont own nor control, same as any other data center out there."
What&#39;s with the parrots in the comments
"Ngl bro......... this interview just seemed REALLY disingenuous, too much media training......"
Talk to this guy with icon arrangement sxxt 😂
"You have to understand that Tim’s words have a huge impact on the stock price. The company could loose hundreds of billions in value if he says something wrong, that’s very stressful for him."
"Finally MKBHD reminded apple of Magic Mouse LOL.<br><br>Next big apple update, apple releases magic mouse 2."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> is the moment we&#39;ve all been waiting for: the ergonomics discussion, the Magic Mouse, and of course, the classic MKBHD reaction! 😄"
That zoom while talking Magic Mouse 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
This guy is doing an interview and marketing the product at the same time. This guy is the greatest salesman ever in the world.
"Magic mouse is a joke.. its painful as hell, im a composer i use Logitech"
"As soon as the very subtle zoom-ins kicked in, i dropped my MacBook 🤣"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> 🤣"
Tim Cook after returning to company: update that mouse right now😂😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> in the benginngggenn... in the beginnnggg... in the beginning"
Why not use s24 in front of him 😂
"What kind of questions are these? You should have asked Tim why Apple&#39;s software quality seems to decline every year. For instance, it&#39;s now impossible to rely solely on Safari for desktop browsing; you constantly need Chrome as a fallback for websites that Safari can&#39;t handle."
will iphone 17 plus happen?
I feel like he is not telling the whole truth.
Is every comment going to be about the Magic Mouse?
"Tim Cook “You decide” sentence …. What does it mean?? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=431"">7:11</a>"
man why can he just do that and i can&#39;t go up there and beat tim&#39;s ass
Sometimes I imagine how Tim Cook would brand a toilet paper from Apple.
That moment when Magic Mouse popped up and Marques grinned at Tim without showing any teeth 🤣.
"Tims watch says its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=210"">3:30</a> (pm presumably), and he&#39;s already closed all his rings, including standing for 11 hours 🤯"
"What was the point of this, he said a whole lot of nothing. Most politically correct interview ever. You didn&#39;t even dare to call him out on the Magic Mouse praise he was giving, we all know the mouse was horrible."
"Min <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=488"">8:08</a>, the, “I do believe where there are moments when you can silence your phone…” is very powerful of a statement coming from Tim. I realized the difference if this AI catching on when going to the Movie Theaters by my own iPhone promoting me by knowing and recognizing the geolocation tags."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=738"">12:18</a> The Magic Mouse? is it the collaboration we did with Disney last year?"
will iphone 16 have 120Hz
Keep it up small channels we can hit 1k subs
"Magic mouse... so ergonomical<br><br>Bruh, it is literally pretty much flat"
What really grinds my gears is that literally everyone slaps AI on their product description even though it just an usual algorithm. Few days ago i camo across a PSU with ai….like cmon now
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> Magic Mouse Moment 🤣"
I took him seriously until he talked about the magic mouse like that lmao
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=340"">5:40</a> even the CEO of the apple has to check in hand and check which model it is 😅😂"
"Those close up shots says everything,When Marques asks Tim about &quot;Magic Mouse&quot;.That was hilarious😂"
iyakku onnum arillappa
"Tim said there were no student developers before the iPhone App Store, that is weird hearing as Apple gave out free WWDC to Student applicants years before that - I was one of them long before the iPhone."
"I&#39;m curious about American business etiquette. In the Arab world, it&#39;s considered disrespectful for someone to sit with their legs facing a superior, even an office boy. Would a similar situation be acceptable in an American interview setting? I&#39;m genuinely interested in learning about these cultural differences, not criticizing."
Tim doesn&#39;t even try to rank them lol
Those ergonomics on that mouse
Tim is super cautious in his speech about AI and especially with Marques.
"Why does Tim&#39;s watch look different from MKBHD&#39;s one. These are both watch Ultras, but Tim&#39;s one looks more sleek and compact."
All the answers seemed like something chatgpt would say
Tim Cook needs to come on South Park
Should have ask about Apple&#39;s anti repair stance and the hilarious attempt to convince the public that apple care about its use privacy.
"Charactecstic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=666"">11:06</a>"
I guess we all came for the magic mouse skit
Marques&#39; face when Tim speak about ergonomics of the Apple Mouse: .__.
So how does Privacy work by sending data to OpenAI ? At this point Privacy seems like Apple myth. Also calling AI as Apple Intelligence sound just as dumb as Alibaba calling AI as Alibaba Intelligence.
"A shame Marques bombed his own interview by focusing on the Magic Mouse, which is the main takeaway from this video (and the comments). Missed opportunity for clicks and views imo"
"Extablished <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=663"">11:03</a>"
"Tim Cook‘s answer about not doing „nefarious“ things with their generative AI, was kind of avoiding the question, but I think only because he does not (need to) know the details. The answer should have been:<br>They don‘t publicly train their model, in fact to fit it on a small device they have a general LLM that focuses on word knowledge over content knowledge and the ability to apply it does not stem from an enormous dataset but from their adapters that add specialized applied knowledge - at least that is what it seems like looking through their technical lessons. While this was needed to get it small it prevents it from doing many things including „nefarious“ instead itÄ‘s even only specific things it can do. The same is true for their images. There are not general images, but officially obtained and tagged ones, so their engine does not even no what a naked person looks like."
Marques trying to cancel Tim
LET HIM COOK!
I don&#39;t agree......
Nice seeing yall talk about “apple intelligence” lol
"One of the best interviews I’ve seen in recent times with one of these CEO’s. No bootlicking or PR softballs. Actual interesting questions. <br>Plus, Tim looked interested to be talking in real things instead of the corporate speak you get with most interviews"
Why you don&#39;t ask:<br>Why macbook M&#39;s generation doesn&#39;t connect with 2 monitors?
Great to see MKBHD collaborating with small creators like Tim Cook.
"Ai , they will use your info guys this goes next level …… don’t buy phone ai product make your stand before to late"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=607"">10:07</a> Did Marques said it’s a very Lebron answer? Because I think it’s the opposite. From the way I see it, Lebron loves to define his legacy. I like the safer answer of Tim."
Magic mouse was indeed NOT an incredible moment. The closeups killed me lmao
"Hahahahaha <br>How many of you realised what MB did there with the Magic Mouse question? hahahahah<br><br>He asked the question on purpose and his empty look on his face when Tim said &quot;ergonomics&quot; <br><br>Good move M, good move !"
"Haha he really has to think what to say about the magic mouse. Thx for the interview, crazy you can sit there with Tim Apple for a talk"
Masterful divert from giving product rankings.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> even tim can&#39;t tell the difference between the new iphones"
Marques why didn&#39;t you use your S24 Ultra in that Interview? :D
I don&#39;t think I have a single apple product but I can respect what people like. BUT ERGONOMICS ON WHAT NAH NAH
Marques just Trolled Tim !!! ahahah
Tim cook is making apple boring just like him☠️
"Who agrees?<br>Tim cook is most curated CEO in the fortune 500, The dude is apples best PR😂 don&#39;t need that department no, just ask Tim cook what to say😂 It&#39;s not that he isn&#39;t genuine, but he just chooses alot of what to say😂 you can never really get his true opinions on screen"
mkphd was fishing by saying magic mouse
The Magic Mouse question has been hilarious
Magic Mouse...... pause
"LOL <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> I love how Marques goes &quot;with magic mouse&quot; like are we talking about the same thing. i just could not hide that face XD."
"As much as the internet loves to hate Tim, he knows his stuff about Apple products"
So like… Tim Cook is real?!
"Old news , today is all about virtual reality with AR"
i literall y fell asleep when tim talks...
CEO talk is so bland and unremarkable. In an attempt to not upset anyone they eliminate any shred of anything meaningful from their words. I could&#39;ve listened to 16 minutes of literal white noise and it would have been more interesting than this.
The magic mouse got me 🤣<br>That scene was so intense! I love that the camera slowly zooms in to their faces hahaaa I love it!
Hello love me from Nepal
Somebody gotta count how many times tim said ‘uhhhh...’😂😂
DOPE 🔥
"The magic mouse, that is hilarious! Great throwing it in there, though feels sad that is out of touch with what people really think."
Buuuyy your mooom an A-EEEYE
Imagine Marques sitting next to Steve Jobs…
You can tell that Tim Cook doesn’t use Vision Pro
Nah Let Tim Cook
"Magic Mouse zooming tim <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
Elon musk impact
"Holy guacamole, Tim is actually able to use the word AI :D. <br>But with whole seriousness, damn Marques - congrats!. Did you ever imagine about that? One day you are some high school dude with a crapy camera doing a review of some mediocre tech, to what - 15y later having a CEO of apple on your channel to chit-chat about some stuff. I might don&#39;t like apple, because of some many reasons and not use their devices because of that, but this is real life achievements, this &quot;interview&quot;. Congrats MKBHD!"
even Apple&#39;s CEO can&#39;t tell the exact version of the iPhone he is looking at LOL
tell him the contact app need picture so old people can see it better before make a call
Hi
Marques is the best🥇
So much crafted BS here lol.
tim is just like me during viva exams
"Essentially Tim means that Apple is not concerned about backward compatibility, reason why you cannot for example develop apps for visionOS on Macs with Intel chips. Just throw your Intel Mac, old iPhones and get the latest ones. Thank me later for decrypting this"
"&quot;Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&quot;<br><br>- William Shakespeare inexplicably describing CEO and politician speak."
Magic mouse IMAO :D :D :D
I miss Steve Jobs...
"Tim Cook sure like his Nike; spectacle, shoes, etc? Imagine him getting &quot;sponsored&quot; by Nike. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
"Compared to Elon Musk, Tim Cook is a CEO that is purely a salesman and not even close to being an engineer that understands what he&#39;s actually selling."
"No real new suggestions, just the same old &quot;AI hype&quot;..."
even when he&#39;s talking it feels like he&#39;s speaking at a keynote
"Marques: &quot;What about the Apple Polishing Cloth?&quot;<br><br>Tim Cook: &quot;Oh, I love the Apple Cloth. I love how it has transformed its market segment.&quot;"
MKBHD: Lets rank.... Tim: Yes!!!
"Poor questions, worst answers."
"Hey Marque..I see you mentioning AI with so much promise and on n on..have you heard of &quot;Lavender&quot; and how it is being used to murder Palestinians. We need people in the tech community to speak up, especially you, since you have such a large following.."
awful &quot;interview&quot; which is basically an apple commercial. Well played by Tim.
"We can all agree that Tim might be the most successful CEO technically, but definitely the worst speaker and presenter of all time, ever. His rhythm, and the sugarcoated emptiness of his sentences is nerve-wrecking. It constantly ruins the flow of the keynotes too since years. God bless Federighi, who can still save it for us - as far as they let him to do it."
This man is so well media trained it’s not funny
Tim Cook looks like AI
Still glad Apple is doing these kind of interviews though.
Magic Mouse
"This interview was wholesome! Mr. Cook&#39;s intelligence, humility and awareness is admirable. MKBHD is toptier interviewer. Simply brilliant!!"
pfff ...
"The interview with Tim it&#39;s HUUUUGE! I was surprised only by the preview of this video. Honestly nothing new. Tim always talks like a politician and with predefined phrases, but still, that is another experience seeing him not only in production but more from a kinda live perspective./"
Marques&#39; reaction when Tim said Magic Mouse and Ergonomics in the same sentence 😂
The &quot;zOOm&quot; on Magic Mouse.👀☠️
"It&#39;s funny not body&#39;s talkin&#39;about Samsung AI , is the best than apple AI there&#39;s some futures on Apple AI that I had on my Sony Xperia xzs in 2017, (Android 8. 0) , but nobody mentioned it"
"This is going to sound crazy, but I really like the magic mouse!"
I see your reactions when he talks about the ergonomics for the Magic Mouse
Tim Crook
"it feels like he&#39;s talking to his shareholders first, his customers second and Marques third.  really wishy-washy and indirect responses. Steve would never 😢"
That smerk on Marques when Tim said majic mouse ergonomics lol
Loved to see you there bro.
Advertisement. Declare it as such.
Great Interview 👍🏽
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> sus"
Would&#39;ve been so cool if mkbhd pulled out a pixel out of his pocket in front of tim cook
"All I heard was a lot of yapping from Tim, ngl"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a> he did that on purpose"
by telling about experience from watching old parrents photos on vision pro he made me both cry and wanting to buy vision pro
Tim definitely does not work off a Vision pro lol
That WWDC logo is really not logoing. All I see is VW logo and it make me think of Volkswagen. lol
"I see what MKBHD did here with the ranking and Magic mouse :) lolz , Cook &quot;The Ergonomics&quot;  MKBHD saying &quot;The Magic mouse&quot; and not laughing 😆"
"Altho I&#39;m happy for you that you got to interview Tim.<br>The interviews with him are always pretty pointless to watch.<br>He is so well media trained that the interviews always turn out boring, he avoids questions, never goes in depth or share interesting views. <br>Even the way he sais &quot;it was great fun&quot; seems passionless. <br>It&#39;s super generic, ironically feels like listening to a chatbot!"
"So many ignorant comments about the magic mouse. Of course &quot;ergonomics&quot; must mean &quot;gamer kids slamming twelve buttons while grabbing the mouse with the whole hand&quot;, it&#39;s not like ergonomics is a science."
I love the Magic Mouse!❤
.
You can tell Marques was nervous and this was an impromptu interview
cool.
Tim Apple*
Thanks for the content
President Biden? Is that you?
"I don&#39;t believe a thing he says about AI. To him it&#39;s only one thing, an opportunity to make a lot of money. The only benefit of this video is a PR piece for Apple."
He said &quot;dub dub&quot; John!!!!!!
Such an underwhelming interview! It could have been so much better
So you&#39;re doing Apple PR. Should have mentioned that.
No way bro got to talk to the CEO of the richest company in the world 😮
"Hey Marques, this interview with Tim Cook was absolutely fascinating! It&#39;s so cool to hear about the latest in tech and AI straight from the CEO of Apple. Your questions were spot on and really brought out some insightful answers. Keep up the awesome work! 👍👍"
"I’m the odd one out, literally only person that thoroughly enjoyed the Magic Mouse 😅"
why does it look scripted?
"Tim Cook not being able to identify the iPhone from the screen is worrying🤣🤣🤣 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=324"">5:24</a>"
Blah
Interviewing billionaires !!  Mark the calendar MKBHD. You&#39;ve arrived !
Sensitive bachu
Side of the Iphoney or side of Elon Musk ... Tacoma owner 🎉
The side eye after ergonomic Magic Mouse😂😂😂
Incredible! Apple Intelligence announced and still no single word about Polish language for Siri!
He DID NOT want to play the ranking game. Super Cringe.
"A wild thought: can&#39;t apple just give Apple Intelligence support to all devices earlier to iphone 15 pro, by doing all the AI requests via &#39;Private Cloud Compute&#39;"
wasnt he meant to rank them - instead just spoke/advertised them. LOL
nobody making the magic mouse had ever used a mouse before
"The biggest mistake from Apple’s WWDC keynote was the low emphasis on security and privacy. <br><br>You’re Apple, show your security and privacy credentials in what is the most important element of data and AI."
Cook seems out of it compared to previous years
"Hihglighting Screen time??? Seriously? It&#39;s the worst possible implementation, it offers ZERO friction for you to prevent you from going back to distraction.  We still need to rely on external apps to keep ourselves off the hook. Even Android&#39;s Digital Wellbeing offers more friction than Apple&#39;s, which is paradoxical given the leeching power of Google."
Tell him to start a kitchen as his name says 😂
OMG this is an interview with the corporate lawyer not Silicon Valley company leader. It is all about PR not innovation
Zooming in on the faces at the 1st mention of the magic mouse....that was brilliant😭😭🤣
hubba bubba
"How miserable is Tim&#39;s life, he can&#39;t speak honestly. There is so much tension in this interview. Poor guy"
I like mkbhd but this was such a disappointing interview. Awful questions
I suspect Marcus turned up to interview Tim Cook with his notes on an Android phone. Did you see Tim’s reaction when he realised it was on the arm of the chair  😂😂😂 mind you it wasn’t there on the next cut
Now it all make sense and why marquez onstantly trying to pedal Apple propaganda thats why his prevíous video was praising Iphones anti consumer design and practices <br>Fair play tho who wouldnt wanna be invited to the party.
Tim:- giving the ergonomic was key<br>Marques:- holds his breath dont say it <br>With magic mouse question mark.
MKBHD: &quot;Iphone&quot;<br>Cook: AAAAAAA!!!! OAUUU!!! AAA!!!😂😂😂😂
Tell him to go easy..dont try too hard to be samsung
"Marq is one of the most considered reviewers, so he can meet the big figures behind giant companies.<br><br>I hope Marq remains consistent in being from the user&#39;s perspective, where if there is something that needs to be criticized, then it must be criticized,<br><br>Not being a sycophant."
"Here <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=386"">06:26</a> he doesn&#39;t say yes. He says &quot;that&#39;s right&quot;. The lawyers thought him well."
Vision Pro: photos to look at in a completely different way?
Sorry to say but this is just another glorified advert for Apple…. Why don’t these interviewers ask more probing questions eg THE RIGHT TO REPAIR and obtaining GENUINE APPLE SPARE PARTS without the hassle of being an ‘Authorised Apple Service Centre’ locking parts and even banning manufacturers selling genuine parts! <br>Would really love to see how this interview would have panned if Louis Rossmann grilled Tim.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> is fire😂😂😂"
it was entertaining to listen to the both of them
"As a matter of fact, there was Palm and its combo that probably lay the foundation for the iPhone"
I was waiting for the &quot;when macos on ipad&quot; question! :(
I like all them talking ❤ respectful ❤😊
nah he’s cooked. time for tim apple to retire
The subtle “the Magic Mouse?“ was perfect. Great interview lots of fun to listen and follow along with!
Apple Intelligence lmao
what a mediocre guy
Can apple fix Facetime? It&#39;s annoyingly buggy. 😢
So… Mr. Tim does not play the blind ranking game 😅
"How much treble do you want? Yes, all of it."
you should have brought the pixel with u just to see tims reaction
He didn&#39;t rank them...
Crash detection and Fall detection doesn&#39;t need AI.
"on magic mouse, Tim 👎"
cameraman did Tim dirty with that zoom in 😅
It is funny how he mentioned company and him personally are focused on forward (don&#39;t even have museums bullshit) and then few minutes later looking at the pictures of his deceased parents in 3D thanks to visionpro :)  well done Tim!
Once Marq said Magic for Magic mouse it Reminded me of Mr.Bean saying &quot;Magic !!!&quot;
It was super funny that Mr Cook looked at your phone and doesn&#39;t understand which IPhone model is hahaha
"That ZOOM man during magic mouse, killed me."
"Tim is really struggling to articulate the implications of the AI integrations , clearly rushed"
I really like Tim Cook
"Amazing CEO, Amazing Interviewer"
Tim closed all 3 rings
"Comedy of Apple .<br>Apple da yine yeni hiçbirşey yok. Bilmem ne zeka farkı pırtıyla ,<br>Eko sistem vb süslü makyajlı laflarla pazarlanmaya çalışılan saçmalıklar dizisi ."
"Tim Cook, Master of saying a lot while saying actually nothing."
Why did you change your phone from s25 to 15 pro max when you want to chat with TC 🤔 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Only Marquez can bully tim freaking cook and getaway with that😂
Wow! He haven&#39;t answered a single question. What a waste
"These guys, they were so awesome when they innovated the USB C last year and now they&#39;ve created and intodruced AI"
old man&#39;s ego lol
"I think it&#39;s disrespectful what Marcus said to him at the end of the video, it&#39;s rude I hope I never get the chance to talk to Tim"
Sus thumbnail NGL.
Never noticed the more Southern accent Tim carries until today
&#39;Ergonomics&#39; and &#39;Well done&#39; and &#39;Simplicity&#39; should not be pronounced in the same sentence for Magic Mouse.
We need a choice of what ai to use!
Make Marques an executive at Apple
&quot;I use the vision pro for it&#39;s uuuhh &quot;entertainment value&quot;.<br><br>That feels like the 15 year old boy talking about having &quot;the Sex&quot;
"there is not a single question that tim answered correctly, atleast not on the same topic lol. Marques asked how the generative AI wont have issues like it did with others, if they had the right tools for it and tim cook started blabbering abt privacy loooool lmaoooo"
The 🤣🤣 MAGIC MOUSE I&#39;M DEADDDDD💀💀💀
"Damn imma just say - Tim Cook has gotten old 😢like man, say what you will, the man is a legend and one of the best professionals in tech. Imagining Apple without him is honestly just as hard as it was imagining Apple without Steve back in the day."
"I hit 2x by mistake, turns out Tim’s pace was perfect."
Where’s your Pixel 8 pro… lol
why didnt you bring your android phone?
"Great work, you two cooked it really well 💖🔥"
"I just wish Tim would keep it real like Steve did they are different People, but it just feels like he bends-backwards to ensure he doesn’t say anything of substance. I understand why he does it marketing and all but Steve proved you can market amazingly while being abrasive. Cause let’s me real I’m sure Tim can be a pain and be serious and frustrated too, I just wish we caught a glimpse of any of it because his public persona feels so soulless."
Too humble to rock the Galaxy that day KEKW
"That moment in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> where Tim doesn’t really recognize what iPhone he‘s looking at 😂"
Waiting next year for Tim to say dub dub
"This interview is already legendary. Two powerhouses. Never has someone dared or been able to put this kind of sarcasm into an interview with Apple?

This Fanboy glow at the beginning. 🚀
Dude i love those nike glasses Tim! Where do I get one?
bro had to keep the laughter inside when talking about the magic mouse
Top 5 Lost turned into a beautiful summary of those products’ internal impact
😑😑😑 BS
For the people starting a business: stufy apple’s marketing and promoting and the way they talk. Idc what you think of apple if you find it a terrible company or not but their marketing is genius
"He&#39;s not getting invited again  <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
"Just ask him who ruined air pods pro ANC, and why apple never respond to the community"
Tim Cooks shoes are lit. Loving them.
softball after softball did someone forget to give tim keynotes cool room tho
I was laughing out loud during the magic mouse part 😂
Tim knew to be careful near Marques 😂 <br>He asks questions like we users ask. Great respect for that.<br>Tim was either confused why there was magic mouse in the list or he didnt know what that was 😂 He was definitely sweating there
Great Interview !You are a talented communicator👍🏽
"Sad, but from few years Apple don&#39;t and didn&#39;t change anything to really improve user interface, user experience or software development what so ever. They even use old built-in VPN protocols in the system, LOL. Privacy instead improving went few levels down due to a lot of AI data collection and possibilities to spy on people. They change or add things that really don&#39;t matter for every day use or to make life easier. And I had two Macbooks and iPhone before M CHIP. AI won&#39;t even matter in practical use for another 100 years. It&#39;s to show off what &quot;device can do&quot; and to blind people and get them exicted they have the latest technology and to using this to rob them of their hard work earned money. Conferences are designed in such a way that it makes you believe that everything they do is so usefull and amazing. In real life 90% of what has been done is no practical or usefull in any way. Big company to scam people of their money."
did Tim use the memory of his parents to advertise for the vision pro?
I&#39;m very happy for Tim to achieve the milestone of talking with MKBHD privately!!!
"Tim know a lot about all his products, Don&#39;t think my CEO knows anything about ours xD"
How to Bullshit your way through an interview !!! 🤣
"Thank you so mutch for this interwiew, keep up with the good work!"
Bro set him up with the magic mouse ranking question hahahahahaha
You should interview him with an android phone in hand and a pixel watch or galaxy watch on hand😅.
What a snooze fest
"It’s crazy to see Marquis nervous. Love you bro, great interview, wish we got some more “real” answers😂"
"Tim has an earnestness that is refreshing. When he was COO under Jobs he had a reputation for being brutally honest and data driven, but he comes across as someone who cares about the human and contrary to the doom-sayers in the media, he&#39;s been an excellent CEO. I dare say the pivot to health and fitness focus was driven by him."
bro didn&#39;t even answer half the questions properly
"This man is very well media trained , didn’t answer more than half the questions but gave a lengthy response to all of them 😂 evasive manoeuvre"
"Tim plays by his own rules. Blind ranking? No thanks, I&#39;ll just say a lot of words instead."
Buddy didn’t answer any of the questions he just promoted all the stuff in WWDC
Sounds like he&#39;s interviewing a politician
"you can tell by Tim Cook&#39;s reaction to magic mouse and vision pro, those are his top 10.   He was struggling to give &quot;apple&#39;esk&quot; descriptions/adjectives to not &quot;dismiss&quot; the products but his tone of voice and the stumbling said everything."
"When Marques realised that  he had Tim in his hands, talking about the Magic Mouse 😂😂😂"
"Tim&#39;s response to Magic Mouse proves he is either disingenuous or completely clueless.<br>NEITHER is a good look. And I gotta say, it&#39;s kind of disappointing to see MKBHD not confront his response and give the viewers a better picture. I realize he needs to be polite and respectful as the interview itself is a big deal, which I&#39;m sure he&#39;s grateful for, but... his brand is honesty to the viewer - telling it like it is, good and bad - and he let that slide for this interview."
Cook sounded like someone who doesn&#39;t use the magic mouse but can&#39;t talk bad about it.
Again a real proof of how Marques is the voice of the people. He pretty much asked everything that I’m curious about what tech giants’ CEOs think.
Magic mouse was an embarrassment. Accept it Tim.
"I&#39;m sorry but, Who let tim cook??"
"Apple, the most sincere and honest company, as honest as their ergonomic Magic Mouse. We are truly lucky to have them. I do not know what would happen if we would not get a new iPhone each years, with 99.9% same features as the last years models. Imagine a world where your old iPhone would not be down-clocked and made slower intentionally by each update. Truly horrible world."
I don&#39;t think this guy knows what he&#39;s talking about 💀
bro does a lot of yapping
Okay get it apple’s AI is private thanks for mentioning it 1000 times  in 16 minutes tim
It would have been funny if you would have thrown him a curve and said &quot;Android Phone&quot; in that list of products just to catch his reaction.
I think Tim thought you had the 16 when he reached for you phone... can&#39;t wait to see what the new iPhone does with these features
Magic Mouse...Haha. Tim had no clue about the ergonomics of the charging port. That is a port that needs be relocated or make it wireless charging. Nice interview Marques
Im always a bit confused with these interviews. A lot of words (from Tims side) but not a lot of information. So... vague?
I wish Marques asked about IPad OS being completely underbaked for the chip it has
The top 5 should have been specific iPhone models - then could have got honest reactions for the 5c &amp; 12 mini. 😊
That last question was just Marques’s excuse to shoehorn in the magic mouse 😂😅👌
Do people have anything else on Apple other then a mouse...?
Magic Mouse 💀
Mark Ass Brownie&#39;s eye game needs some updates.
Magic Mouse is still in my abandoned tech draw along with my Nokia.
Tim cook really struggled with rating the Magic Mouse 😂
"Apple: &quot;AI? Never heard of her&quot;<br>Apple, 5 years later: &quot;AI? Oh yeah, that thing we came up with&quot;"
"Magic Mouse, step child"
why Apple&#39;s CEO is so shaky and uses aaws as a daily driver.
watched the whole video. went to comments to see if ANYBODY caught the magic mouse moment. realizing that&#39;s the ONLY thing anyone is talking about lmao really a full circle moment for all of us 🥲
"&quot;Legacy is something that is defined by other people looking at you, not something that you define yourself&quot;. <br>🔥<br>&quot;Focus on the forward, not the rear-view mirror&quot;"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=543"">09:03</a> It&#39;s not a good question to ask Marq"
😂😂 getting the ergonomics right!! Marques was like bruhh!!
LeBron answer 😂😂😂
Let Tim Cook
"One question I was waiting to hear, why don&#39;t you give reviewers products?"
Tim is amazing 💙
I&#39;d like to see you ask him about repair and intercompatibility with other devices. I know the answer is bs but I want him to have to admit it.
how we should just apple that using open AI that is a third party company that might leak all our data through that company
The smirk on his face when he said magic mouse lol 😂
Wow. This is a historically epic interview. Great job MKBHD! 🎉
He&#39;s so scared of saying anything that can sound like one product is not worth it&#39;s money so cant even rank stuff for fun 😂😂 all 5 is just the best that anyone has ever seen. Even tho the mouse is absolutely trash 😅
"From a journalistic perspective, I feel this interview could have been done better and maybe produced more meaningful answers from Tim Cook.<br><br>For starters, at some moments it looked to me like Marques kind of matched Tims energy and seemed not to be overly focused on Tim and his answer. And I wondered why this was shown, as usually you would hide that through editing.<br><br>There was subtle critique and second guessing of Tims answers, yes, but overall I felt Marques let Tim get away with a lot of corporate speak that says a lot while not conveying anything meaningful."
He got away without ranking anything 😂
"You did say &quot;rank these things&quot;...,  right?"
Nice and relaxed interview with Tim. Great job and thanks Marques!
I think the last section could have been better by just asking straight forward questions rather than extracting his thoughts indirectly!!!
ijustine as the next apple CEO?
i know the corpo talk is needed because he has too much responsibly but i wish there were more honest opinions
"Like watching paint dry, nothing new compared to your last vid that was super helpful and interesting."
Don’t like these pre approved sanitised interviews. Tells us nothing. Pointless questions and pointless answers.
Freaks in the comment section proclaiming their love for the magic mouse as a justification to why it was a good idea
"The insanity of tim cook, calling magic mouse ergonomic!"
Guess no interview if brought your S24U 😂
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a> (the magic mouse) {thinks for a second}it was also an incredible moment 😂😂😂. Apple always painting glorious pictures of everything they have ever done.😜"
"There is a fine line that MKB walks with getting in good questions while still being on the good side of these corporations. I’m actually glad he didn’t hold Tim to the fire on the rankings. I agree we got a cool retrospective and the variety of products he asked about was perfect, especially ending with Apple Vision Pro. As PR focused as Tim is, I think we got some authentic answers. Bravo!"
look at the size if his pupils
bro is trolling tim with magic mouse
Haha I love Tim but that mouse ranking…dude come on man!
"marquees reaction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> <br>he be like im gonna kill you wtf ergonomics it is apple ergonomics"
Hello Marques. It wasn&#39;t a good interview. You should ask him more difficult and challenging questions. You are a good tech reviewer and sometimes a good critique. This was a great chance to challenge Apple&#39;s CEO. As always thank you for your good reviews and wish you the best.
What has Tim Cook added to Apple other than rainbow washing everything
Marques is running the interview so well !!!
What shoes is Tim using?
"i like his sentiment around apple wanting not to be first but to be the best. however, the main selling point for me with technology is GAMING. when do they plan to be the best for gaming? Nevermind being first - they&#39;re still not even on the board as far as i understand it."
The Magic Mouse Moment was 😂😂😂😂
YEOOOHHHH PROOOIIIIIIVICY has been a PRIOOOOORITY
mkbhd not holding back on these questions
You know you’re a big deal when you can get Tim Cook to sit down with you and chat
ergonomics guys
This just tells you this channel is legit just advertisements now
Playback speed 1.5x
"This is might be my own opinion or culture in where I live, but seeing Marques sitting with figure four lock pose while the sole facing Tim Cook was kind a bit disrespectful"
"First time I’ve felt Tim is out of his element and almost aged out of Ai. From his tone, feels like apple and Ai is mucky"
Did the production team refuse the blind ranking?
Magic Mouse: Cuts straight to MKBHD hiding World&#39;s frustration 😅
magic mouse and ergonomics 🤦🏻‍♂️
Tim sounds like he should retire.<br><br>Old and raspy.<br>Greedy and weak.
"MKBH is a very intelligent and observing person, man of few words and  body language 😂.  I, for one, would have signed at the Magic mouse being called ergonomical 😂"
they just copy android
Magic Mouse zoom on Marques&#39; face 🤣🤣🤣
I had a nice time watching this Interview :)
Ahaha the akward Magic Mouse moment !  Come on Tim. Just make it better
Privacy is a human fundamental right. I hope it was considered as mentioned!
The vibe of the video changing when the magic mouse come up tells everything..
<i>ICT🌥 12PM Jun 13th 2024</i>
Tech n* and gay ceo in one frame
"Shadows on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=896"">14:56</a> , is that a hint?"
Magic mouse 💀
I play this video to my brothers and sisters who work the mines in congo. They loved it.
Silence for spam texts and calls would be great!
iPhone 15
"Apple indirectly admitted that chatGPT is the king  of LLM as of now. Sorry, If I am wrong."
Apple died with Jobs.
"Tim&#39;s face when Marques said &quot;Magic Mouse&quot; He realized he just walked into a trap. Nice one, Marques."
So many potential meme moments here.
Always looking forward and never looking back is a great way to never learn from your mistakes. Great leadership tactic.
Why does this looks like a job interview 😂
Is no one gonna comment on Tim cook looking a little too jacked? Are my eyes playing tricks on me or is this guy hitting the JIM
lol he didn&#39;t even hesitate saying ergonomics with magic mouse🤣🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> is why Marques is the best. Tim didn&#39;t really answer the &quot;How so?&quot; question."
Tim&#39;s mike is not working well
Great talk...ty
You gotta give it to Tim and Apple that they always think and talk from the perspective of customers. In the end thats what a business is about and for. For us. At least the good ones are.
"What makes me laugh the most is that last year&#39;s 14 pro model won&#39;t get artificial intelligence, why? Because yes XD This is the last time I fell for this ridiculous company, never again Apple! :/"
Tim evaded the Blind Ranking game gracefully.
"I was waiting for Marqeues to say, &#39;Hey Tim, just one more thing: why iPadOS sucks?!&#39;"
Pretty mid interview to be honest
MKBHD - Interesting is your word of choice in this interview.
Let’s do a blind ranking. <br><br>No… I don’t think that I will.
Great seeing tim with marques and the questions where really challenging and i liked it a lot and another thing marques could you make videos about affordable phones i am looking for great affordable phones.
"The generative AI approach was kinda obvious, the aesthetics they offer for their final result are starkly unreal: illustration, sketched, and animation. None of those three selections can be mistaken for a photograph. Ergo, it can&#39;t be used to falsify &quot;real&quot; images of people"
&quot;we already viewed privacy as a fundamental human right&quot; Tim Cook
This man sounds like Mr Mackey from south park
The slight zoom in on the Tim&#39;s face and Marques Face when they talk about Magic Mouse 😂
Nothing matters in this world anymore. The founder of apple said the word extablished not once but twice.. fml
How much did Nike pay for the Tim Cook brand integration?
Marques meets cook once a year for interview and cooks apple the same year when a new I phone drops 😂
haha... only marquess can ask about magic mouse :D
&quot;Our objective is never to be the first but our objective is to be the best&quot;
ill be so happy if tim cook said &quot;erm what the sigma&quot;
bro struggled to think of something good to say about the magic mouse
From his reaction to the rankings I would say to him:<br><br>1. iPhone<br>2. iPad <br>3 and 4. tied MacBook Air and Vision Pro<br>5. Magic Mouse
Can we have a feature to remove or make invisible the dynamic island in screen recording and screen mirroring?<br>It&#39;d be pretty nifty for gaming content creators. The feature itself is awesome but doesn&#39;t look very nice on those gameplay videos!
I also think that Mr.Cook is well aware of the real perceptions of the &quot;ergonomics&quot; of the magic mouse. So he actually brought that up to demonstrate it. But at the same time on this setting and in his position he will never talk bad about their product. Well managed in my humble opinion. 👀👍🏼
Ahhhhh this is gold. &quot;Getting the ergonomics... well.. done... was key for the magic mouse.&quot; Even Tim couldn&#39;t say that sentence without second guessing it.
"Tim is perfectly avoiding true answers sometimes, like Magic Mouse thing"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> magic mouse?, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> OK!"
Really...😂
MKBHD great video and interview with Tim Cook. AI got to Apple 😂❤❤.<br>Keep up with great work and more interesting interview&#39;s with tech CEOs.
"He&#39;s done a great job, but please fix the iPad"
Marques dropped a bomb by including the magic mouse😂😂😂😂😂😂
I miss the days of Apple innovating.  I used to stop everything to watch the keynote.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=126"">2:06</a> listen carefully..."
"What about some hard questions , like split screen in ios"
Tim Apple talks like a career politician. He&#39;d say so much without saying anything.
The Magic Mouse killed me😂😂😂😂
Is that the cover image from the Magic Mouse part?
If this man fights against Mayweather I&#39;m positive he will win.
The next &quot;calculator for the iPad&quot; moment will be the &quot;new redesigned magic mouse&quot; ❤
At least we&#39;ve &quot;extablished&quot; that Tim doesn&#39;t know what the word ergonomic means.
so nice of mkbhd to support small companies like apple
I tuned out at “We’ve been executing with AI”. Sorry.
You can see in Marques&#39; face he ain&#39;t buying it when Tim talked about the ergonomics of the magic mouse.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=657"">10:57</a> Did Tim say extablished? And moments later extablishing?"
GOoOD IDEA and Made In…🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  (always waiting and less brain work)  👇💰👇   🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌏🌎🌍🌞 .
The MagicMouse part was awkward 😬
"Tim said &quot;Extablishing&quot; not once, but twice. Which means that&#39;s how he pronounces it. Who&#39;s gonna tell him?"
Apple needs a new ceo
&quot;Getting the ergonomics well done is the key&quot;<br>&quot;With magic mouse&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah&quot;<br>&quot;okay!&quot;<br>gawd🤣🤣
with AI comming in will apple make appleid account recovery easier?
"Marques, I think this is the moment you can say “I’ve made it.” Congratulations!"
First Apple video where comments are not disabled.
"Question at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=200"">3:20</a> was great"
You gotta be more aggressive in these
"MKBHD: are you sure data is not being sent to open Ai<br><br>Tim : that’s right… YOU DECIDE <br><br>@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=387"">6:27</a>"
Tim is not good infront of the camera and infront of a big creator. Tim is a small creator. Tiny Tim
"lovely video, weird audio?"
Why MKBHD stop reviewing CHINESE PRODUCT TECH
"Tim Apple be like &quot;magic mouse... ah... uhhhh.... ergonomics!&quot;<br>Camera zooms in on Marques&#39; cheeky smile<br>Audience laughs, peak meme moment"
Marques wouldn’t DARE bring his android phone to this meeting. wise.
"Great interview, Marques!"
"That’s beautiful, make a product so great that you don’t remember it exists, yet you need it to function every day 😮"
Thank goodness the Vision Pro exists so I can look at photos of my dead father in a new light!
"MKBHD pulled a Tim Apple, that&#39;s impressive"
"Imma be real here, the Magic Mouse felt great for me when I used it. The ergonomics for me were fine"
You can tell Tim Cook has the best PR training. Man phrases his answers in a way that seems like it answers the questions but actually does not.
"Apple hasn&#39;t created any AI yet, they&#39;re begging openAI for API or some code."
"Tim Cook, more like Tim Hook"
Now Tim wants to change his last name to &quot;Toast&quot;
We need to take a second to realize how good of an interviewer Marques is. He asks direct and hard questions with respect but no fear. 10/10 interview
"You need to step up your interview game! The questions aren&#39;t interesting, in fact they are quite basic."
Let’s make dangerous things fun by removing the edges😂
what the heck was tim cooking about that magic mouse?😭😂😂😂
Let Tim Cook 😂
he lied when you asked about vision pro
Love sociopathic speeches to tell the value of a product via pathos
two of the smoothest humans on earth
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=319"">5:19</a> we&#39;re using the same basic architecture that&#39;s in... (checks if he&#39;s using iphone)"
"You can tell Tim hates the magic mouse as much as we all do. You could see on his face, and then on his words, he was having a very difficult time to support what is Apples worst product, by far."
not a single question was answered that day.
Surprised your audio is so bad for the level of your channel<br><br>Clean your audio up! There&#39;s buzzing and clipping in this
"I never thought I would hear &quot;Magic mouse&quot;, &quot;incredible&quot;, and &quot;ergonomic&quot; in a sentence without a &quot;not&quot;"
after his bit faffing on about repairability in the durability video at least mkbhd came to his senses this time around
I love the magic mouse it’s sooooo simple
"I like his reviews, but I think, based on this interview, he is not a very good interviewer. No follow ups. No interesting questions. Maybe Apple PR wouldn’t let him… but even so, I think puff pieces like this don’t add value to Marques’s brand"
I miss steve jobs
Tim a is a professional waffeler. Bro said a whole lotta nothing ☠️
The focus comment about legacy is incredible Tim. Forward thinking and timely.
Also how did I feel like agreeing with everything tim said (I completely disagree with everything he said but be felt so compelling)
"love the magic mouse thing, didnt get the hint or he doesnt use it at all hahah"
MKPhd
you let bro cook with magic mouse 😂
Let tim cook.
Wish there was more talk with Tim Apple about adding Mac OS on iPad.
Why does his polo have different colored buttons 😫
Talking Ai with our boi Tim Apple
"Marques, longtime watcher of your content, good interview! You had the chance to offer your condolences 💐 when he told you about his parents tho. Keep your edge sharp as you always do, please don’t forget to stay humble 🙏🏻"
"I like how Tim Cook danced around answering the ranking questions!💃👯<br>Dancing around in those socks, though... I wonder if Apple will ever release some kind of iSocks... 🤔🤔🤔"
Bro has logic up in the mix homie
Why does Tim seem so depressed and blank in this interview. He’s always so excited and happy to have a conversation
wow the fact that he is just casually talking to tim cook! you are incredible.
HAHAHA MAGIC MOUSE ERGONOMIC!?!? 😂
Amazing to watch the art form of answering questions without really answering them in full effect
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> for the magic mouse clip"
"With magic mouse,ok, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=771"">12:51</a>  this killed me 💀"
the most boring video I&#39;ve ever seen from Marques
“Yeah what do you use vision pro for”<br><br>Ruthless
Uau I never see Tim Cook in such a relaxed state.He&#39;s seems very cool dude.Very interesting interwiev Marques.Well done man❤️👍🏽
So are they going to show the cloud inferstucter they have build that insures your requests are processed privately. Coz this it not something where you just say &quot; we worked hard to get it right&quot; you need to have hard proof that it is.
"loving the recent use of logic lol its quite fitting my friend, as always this is an incredible video, very glad you brought up the fact they never called it A.I."
"I love these interviews especially the apple ones, they&#39;re a pretty tight lipped company. However I do wish Tim&#39;s responses weren&#39;t so fakery positive and almost ad like. It&#39;s clear that the responses are heavily curated through PR training."
Number one Apple product was the original 128k Mac.
Tim closed all his rings I see. Good man
charging the magic mouse is like charging the gen1 apple pencil<br>just...<br><br>why?
wud be cool if apple made a audio player with high quality dac with huge storage to kill the competition.. sony out here charging 1k for their <b>high end dac</b> yet in some areas the ipod classic still outperforms it. also depending on a clunky version of andriod
The zooming was perfect 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one who thinks Tim speaks like a calm Mr/Ms. Garrison from South Park
Tim just Overcook
Interviewer: Insightful questions🤓<br>Interviewed: Uninspiring answers😒<br>Missing Steve.
talk back about privacy maybe?
Finally 🙌🏾 Tim has sat down with MKHBD!! 2024 has been one wild and interesting year thus far!!!
Tim Cook must’ve been terrified that Marques would give an honest review so he took this interview. lol<br>At this point apple is just big brother.
"Apple’s commitment to privacy was what brought me back to Apple. To hear Tim lay it out so directly, in the context of AI made me feel good about the company."
"The apple mouse was funny, maybe it will nudge apple to give their mouse “THE IPAD CALCULATOR TREATMENT."
"Seriously, the iPad is the best tablet? He should get his facts checked"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a>  uhmm... the magic mouse, 🤔..."
"topic of Magic Mouse starts <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=747"">12:27</a> , marques controlling all the anger in single shot 😂"
Ergonomics and the Magic Mouse don’t go together Tim.
"I am the only one happy that beign marques as a &quot;not biased&quot; tech reviwer, they gave him the oportunity to be there after all the apple critics and stuff? Still Marques is kinda him now but still cool. Great video MKBHD"
Tim Cook sounds like the male version of the “you are now one of my ELITE employees” video. Change my mind
Anyone at all who thinks that mankind is capable of handling AI in a &quot;safe way&quot; is three steps beyond naive -- whatever you would call someone three steps beyond that term. This isn&#39;t merely &quot;playing with fire&quot; as the expression goes. Making playing with AI is more like playing with the &quot;inner elemental components that make up fire&quot; -- and its the middle of July -- in a hot forest.
Nice job Marques!
"If you’ve seen MKBHD’s videos, you know he was fighting hard to hold his laugh when Tim was struggling to find adjectives to describe the Magic Mouse"
"Missed the boat on Magic Mouse. It’s gestures, not ergonomics!"
Does this feel like a pre terminator vibe to anyone else?
"Out of nearly 6k comments, approximately 90% are fawning over the magic mouse &quot;gotcha&quot; part. You people are easily entertained."
this simmer my iphone is TOO HOT to try any feature
Tim thinking: marques you&#39;re not getting invited to anything apple related again 😂
Am I the only one who has a feeling that Tim&#39;s answers were generated in ChatGPT?
its hilarious when cook tries to remember what the magic mouse is !
"When @MKBHD got back to his hotel room, he switched to a Samsung 😅"
He said windows tehee
tim: &quot;we had to make sure we got the ergonomics right (with the magic mouse)&quot;<br><br>MKBHD: <b>using every ounce of strength in his body not to start screeching</b>
Vision Pro is dead!!! At least in its current hardware/system configuration. Kudos to the idea but you are ahead of the curve. That is something Apple typically is not so the future is intriguing here.
I bet Tim uses Logi mouse with his Mac 😂
"You should push back more, it’s boring to see an interview with no challenge"
"Marques was DEFINITELY holding in his laugh at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> when Tim was talking about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse  😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"&quot;It&#39;s tough. Not to make it personal, but I can&#39;t send my mom certain videos,” to which Mr Cook quickly responded with, &quot;Buy your mom an iPhone.&quot; Yea Tim Cook can suck it!"
Tim: &quot;Getting the ergonomics well done was key.&quot; <br>Marques. &quot;Of the Magic Mouse?... Okay&quot;<br>Marques&#39; face &quot;Are you sure sir!?!&quot;
"Yes, the Iphone changed the world. No, it is not a 4/5, it is a 10/1. It was a true monumental shift. Apple continued until Iphone 4 and then became complacent, scared, or clear direction. Apple should own 80+% market share based on their initial direction."
Tim Apple!
blind ranking game made no sense
"Magic Mouse, eh?"
I’ll rank him a solid 8/10 for not answering questions only politicians get 9/11 - 10/10
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ecstablished
Where&#39;s your S24 ultra ? 😂
tim haven’t prepared for this<br><br>and marques was ready for this<br>😂😂😂😂
"Jesus this just keeps on giving. The magic mouse sucks, universally as one of the biggest oversights on small electronics. Continued discredit to Apples understanding of its products."
"When Tim Cook said Ergonomics, Marques should have handed him the Mouse."
The ranking is rather simple.<br>1. Iphone<br>2. Mac Book<br>3. Ipad<br><br>Magic Mouse and Vision Pro shouldn&#39;t be on a list with those three. Not in the same universe.
Probably good he is flashing his iPhone as his daily driver during this specific interview 😂
At some point there will be a new CEO <b>Marques rubs his hands together</b>
"Tim Cook &quot; I could not live without my Ipad today.&quot; OK, why? Why would an Android tablet of choice not meet 90%+ of your needs. Watching in real time so maybe this will be answered."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> that looks scream &quot;bro, the charging port&quot;"
This was a dope convo
The mouse 🐁 is a 0
"Great interview! But I think the audio needs a noise filter, there&#39;s a pretty loud AC hum throughout the video."
He said he was forward thinking and doesn’t look back. He then mentions he looks at his deceased parents photos on Vision Pro lol
Two of my most favourite people doing the most boring chit chat 😅<br><br>Yet I&#39;d hit likes and shares coz of my favouritism
Wish you would have asked him why he hates American Labor and loves cheap Chinese communist labor.
Tim was never going to rank apple<br>products. 😅
Tim seems like he has no idea what he&#39;s talking about lmao
<b>Interesting.</b>
"Tim Cook &quot;It&#39;s like ranking your favorite niece&#39;s or nephew&#39;s.&quot; No, that is how blind rankings work when you dont fully understand the larger picture. This is an easy gotcha outside of the top influencers who know the customer base."
that&#39;s a great conversation
That zoom in when TIm thinks about Magic Mouse tho. CLASSICCCC!!!!!
This is big for Tim
Was i the only one expecting Marcus to use his android phone in the interview 😅
Love how he uses logics beats for the intros
You can&#39;t help but to love Tim and Marques - very pleasant chat - thank you.
Would be amazing if MKBHD had Samsung S24 Ultra in his hand while asking questions 😅😂🙃!
"Tim Cook &quot; I am always focused on the forward and not the rear view mirror&quot;. Ok, so you are concerned with your legacy, that is understandable. <br><br>Rear view mirrors not focused on the past  but potential futures. Let Samsung build it, prove it, bring it to the masses, and Apple polish it 5 years later."
this is an instant classic. I would&#39;ve liked to hear more about their AI. something about this next update feels like a pivotal moment in time
"Marques you definitely are a smart dude, keeping the Magic Mouse in between those devices was an absolute genius idea 😅"
"The Magic Mouse, to me, does not seem to be ergonomic. I hate it sometimes, but when combined with BetterTouchTool, it can be surprisingly useful like something like swiping on the mouse to create gesture shortcuts. Of course, one can do the same with regular mouse + Touchpad..."
Bummer that the blind ranking didn’t really work out. Good stuff though
So no questions about apple use of coltane and that leading to the suffering of kids in congo 🇨🇩
"when tim was talking about same silicon during privacy talk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a>, and wanted to know which iphone is it, because can&#39;t tell by just looking, and marques said 15 while smiling, it was absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣"
I don’t know how you kept a straight face when he said ergonomics
"The Vision Pro photos part, talking about his parents, was dark man. That does resonate with the first reveal months back when the guy was sitting in an empty room looking of photos of his family."
Did i miss something.  Nothing was ranked.
I thought the vision pro was dead?
Good interview. Don’t comment often on these videos but it was well done and Tim seemed candid in his responses.
"&quot;Privacy for thee, not for me.&quot; This may be a pessimistic take, but Apple is selling the lie of privacy while hoarding every bit of data generated by your devices. They all are, Apple is just the biggest offender."
Apple is notorious for micromanaging everything to its core so I don’t know how generative AI is supposed to work in Apple ecosystem.
Tim Cook is one smart dude crazy how some people you just need to be quiet and listen to them
Tim Cook was Cooked when the Magic mouse was mentioned. Imagine using magic mouse and ergonomics in teh same sentence.
Tim reaching for MKBHD’s not iPhone lol😂
Love your videos! Have you considered reviewing smart rings?
The Magic Mouse segment takes the cake.
"Tim Cook is not very interesting to listen to, I learnt nothing about anything from this vid"
"“We always focus on the forward”<br><br>Yeah sure mate. That’s why you took so long to move to USB C on the iPhone. And why your Magic Mouse has a port on the bottom. On and why you stuck with USB 2 speeds for so long, even on pro iPhones that can create insane file sizes for videos. <br><br>Yep, sure."
I don&#39;t know how you didn&#39;t ask him about the magic mouse charging situation
Ask real questions.... Fake
"I cant stop with comments on this. Tim Cook suggesting Apple does not want you to engage heavily with their ecosystem....WTF! Screen time monitoring is literally the equivalent of a cheap step counter... Cool story, everyone thinks about steps, and yet 99% do not really care."
Who doesnt remember the incredible moment of the magic mouse!
Tim Cook reminds me of how biden reacts to questions
I want more interviews like this.<br>P.S. The comments section 😂
A very nice chat with subtle innuendoes.
"From reviewing media remotes in old laptops, to interviewing Tim Cook himself. Marques would never have dreamed this was possible when he first started. Proud of you brother."
Tim definitely hasn&#39;t found a use for Vision Pro and couldn&#39;t remember what Magic Mouse was...
"Magic Mouse&#39;s response was a bit unexpected, and the camera switched to a zoomed-in view of Marques with a determined look on his face, saying, &quot;I got you, Tim.&quot;😉"
&quot;Magic Mouse...&quot; I immediately scrolled down to the comments and wasn&#39;t disappointed loooool
lmao
oofff
"If there is something I could short in the short-mid term its generative AI. Super hype, Super promises, likely to underdeliver with longer term let down. Longer term generative AI wont be the terminology we use. It will be the terminology of limited human understanding today. Generative AI is not the true battlegrounds companies are racing towards. Open sesame to the little guy that understands the true future. Good luck &quot;insert text&quot;"
Was this an AD instead of an interview? @mkbhd
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> when he said getting the ergonomics well done, I think he meant getting the ergonomics, well, done, not getting them done well."
oh hi from Cambodia 🇰🇭
Just imagine Marques carrying a S24 Ultra and ask abt the competition 😂
literally cant wait for the next waveform episode lol
"I think Tim is talked out, I feel like that sometimes the words don&#39;t come out fluidly when I&#39;m tired or over worked. Take a rest Tim!"
Than you fof coming 😂
apple really has gone downhill
Marques...<br>How did you sit through this marking PR propaganda bullshit... 🙃
Why is Tim Cook nervous to give you the interview…????
Marquez trolling tim to his face without him realizing is priceless 😂
It would have been a baller move if he had brought a pixel instead of an iphone.😂
apple is folding like a house of cards.. just give up. Android is superior and you&#39;re never going to top it.
good morning
Wow this guy said nothing the entire interview.
I like Marques as an interviewer but holy heck Tim Cook was vomiting corporate buzzwords the entire time.
The magic mouse 🤣🤣🤣
Apple where is ur 4k fone? Wake me up when its ready
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=63"">1:03</a> Tim had 11 stands, 88 minutes of work out by 3:17pm on WWDC Keynote Day"
"What a stark contrast, not only skin tones&#39; reflection in the dim room, but the real grasp of Apple product knowledge or not."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=992"">16:32</a> , this could be solid meme template"
Seeing marques do a double take on the magic mouse was peak nerd comedy godamn
Why did you finally start calling it AI after avoiding it?<br>Tim: &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot;<br>Translation: Stock Price
Buy your mon a Iphone
This is what I love about Marques <br>He never fake it. His question always get to the point that people want to know.<br>I&#39;m glad that Tim Cook let him interview too even it wasn&#39;t direct answer but he still answer a lot
Nah he&#39;s too slow man it&#39;s time for a new CEO unfortunately
This was sooo dope!
tim sounds like he&#39;s using ai  for the answers
Great Interview
Omg the ergonomics? 😂😂😂 fr?
"I’ll remember that there wasn’t a gps in the initial iPhone too. And now fitness, findmy, maps, etc wouldn’t work without it."
Apple needs to innovate their Phone design…simple…
Thanks for sharing it. ✌️
You think they’ll ask Marques to be the next Apple CEO?
Who let h...Tim cook
"Tim is getting on at 63, must be time to retire soon? Who&#39;s going to take over?"
tim cook 2030: &quot;today apple is going to reinvent artificial intelligence.&quot;
"The little things that ai does to normalize your everyday life and you can have more time for yourself then the phone itself, but people tend to forget that there is life beyond the screen"
I&#39;m glad Apple are being careful with AI.  That&#39;s the impression I got.
"I like your question on how Tim used VisionPro. Super emotional answer by him that connected with me, for him to be able to see pictures of his parents brings nice memories that are not replicable on other media."
Day live in the meeting time president&#39;s Apple team social time word world media community communication transportation budget
😅Magic Mouse and vision pro was hilarious! SO cringe to see a Tim Cook interview😮
Rich people are destroying our generations and our way of thinking by enforcing dangerous technologies into our lives without the thinking of the mental development that some can&#39;t cope with depending on the education they have on this new technologies. They have so much power over our lives that it&#39;s horrific.
😅Magic Mouse and vision pro was hilarious!
Just lower yout phone price 😂 and dont be greedy thats all
Marques did Tim Cook dirty with the Magic Mouse name drop… 😦
"I think the integration of ChatGPT in the iOS with this pop message that ask you if you want to continue do this task by using AI, is a major point for apple on the conscious use of generative AI by its users. This feature of the new iOS will give more freedom to choose how, where and when to use generative AI...."
Am I the only one that thinks all of these “Tim Apple” comments are bots?
So close on that blind ranking but nope
"A lot of people are laughing at Tim’s use of ‘ergonomics’ and ‘’magic mouse’ in the same sentence, and rightfully so. Me personally, I would love to see them do a modern redesign of the Magic Mouse and one that actually improves the ‘ergonomic’ feel of it in the hand while also expanding on the multi-touch functionality it can perform. I believe they really could produce an exceptional “point-and-click” experience if they really wanted to, maybe Marques mentioning it in this interview will spur Tim and co. into wanting to actually revamp and modernize it."
“I’m reviewing Vision Pro apps (to review 🤭)”
Bro&#39;s face when he mentioned &#39;ergonomics&#39; for magic mouse said it all 😂😂😂😂
Tim Apple being diplomatic...  &quot;another huge/incredible moment!&quot;
this was the best one!
is the first time Marques is interviewing Tim on camera?
The creepy zooms when talking about magic mouse.
Interesting discussion!
That was savage bringing up the Magic Mouse
"Tim feels intimated by Marques, and rightly so to be honest, this man is the largest of tech reviewers and consistently puts consumers first, calls out bs from companies and of course now recently has a history of ending companies and changing tech stock values. Tim seemed so anxious about not plummeting the value for shareholders that he fell back onto media training and didn&#39;t really answer the questions or play along at all with the ranking premise. He knows the magic mouse is bad, but most annoyingly is that he fell into this rhythm of praising all their products that he couldn&#39;t stop and switch to saying it&#39;s the worst, especially while Apple is still selling it with no alternative on the horizon, it would mean admitting they&#39;re selling a bad product to consumers. <br><br>A better answer to the question would&#39;ve been something like &quot;The magic mouse introduced some fantastic features to the category that hasn&#39;t existed, and still doesn&#39;t exist elsewhere, the multitouch surface is great and works fantastically with MacOS and it&#39;s gesture interface, but the product has space to grow and i&#39;m excited for people to see where we take it next&quot;, granted that would be hard to think of on the fly under the pressure he was likely feeling, and it would mean soft announcing a product and admitting some level of imperfection which is very un-Apple in their ironclad PR strategy, but it would&#39;ve been more genuine and endearing. <br><br>The best answer of course would&#39;ve just been &quot;5&quot;, so that this segment of the interview would take 1-2 mins max rather than 6 mins. Talking about Apple&#39;s past products used up a lot of the interview time that could&#39;ve and should&#39;ve been used elsewhere, it&#39;s frustrating that the media training filibustering got in the way of the other questions Marques had lined up."
"I really enjoyed this interview.  At the end Tim shared with us an emotional point of view by using Vision Pro. I think thats apple vision, enhancing people’s experiences through their products."
Tim: getting the ergonomics was key<br><br>Marques: with Magic Mouse??? (in his mind: are you fucking kidding me😂😂😂)
This is honestly so great to see. The transparency from such a huge company like apple is amazing. The seriousness with which Tim treats this interview is awesome too.
Dropping Magic Mouse like that was totally worth not getting any real rankings from Tim. Bravo Marques. 👏
"If I answer questions like Tim does during a job interview with Tim, I know I&#39;m not getting that job"
Hey marcus while you were with tim you should have told him to decrease the price in his products
man being a ceo you’ve gotta be so careful with what you say haha
Reading the comments and everyone is just focused on Magic Mouse <b>smh</b>
what exactly is tim cooking?
Don’t forget the hands shakes feelings in the first meet… ❤😅😊
same answering structure as iJustine interview
My man Tim had all those circles closed
"Nice interview… not very inquisitive but I guess that’s fine, better way to get answers"
4 truth and 1 lie with Tim Apple
"I also can’t live without notebooks everyday, same to cards. Not only Apple."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=745"">12:25</a> nahh bro the reaction marques gave was every person&#39;s reaction at that moment😂😂"
Tim did everything BUT rank the Apple products lol
Apple doesn’t look back<br>“Apple releases 300$ book about all their product history”
"A Pen and An Apple, a Keyboard.<br><br>Kidults world hahahahaha"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=670"">11:10</a> Notice the emphasis he places on his words here. I wonder if he’s alluding to something else. 🤔"
He sounds like he doesn&#39;t know shit about his products
You had him at magic mouse! Only if he could speak his mind and say &quot;I know it sucks&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> really tim? Ergonomic?👀"
I’m boycotting apple who’s with me?
ERgONoMicS<br><br><br>Another &quot;buy your mom an iPhone&quot; moment
關德興
Tim was not tryna play the ranking game😂
Uhh so i&#39;ve been talking to tim cook for few weeks
One thing Ive always respected Apple for is their willingness to be second to market to increase the likely hood of doing it better rather than looking incompetent by rushing garbage out the door because money. Siri has been so close to utterly useless for so many years that to see it taking a giant step to the front of the line is great. An actual voice assistant that is useful will be the first feature to make me care about what they are doing in phones in 5 years and they know it because there was zero chance of me upgrading my mini13 otherwise...Still think its sucky of them when older phones could obviously run it.
"Jeez, Tim’s getting old."
We all know that Tim was Caping when he said The ergonomics of the magic mouse are &quot;well done&quot;
Should have asked why the charge cable for a mouse was on the bottom. Lol
Apple views privacy as a human right...except in China.
Wish we had AI that just speeds up slow-ass talkers like Cook ... but plays the rest of the video at normal speed.
"Watching your interview just taught me how Tim views the different products. In particular the moment about Vision Pro taught me why that product hit the market the way it did with its focus on Enterprise. There’s the possibility that the iPad while it has fans that want to use it as everything device, iPad has its development currently rooted in pencil driven tasks and you can see that by the way the calculator app was released along with Logic and Final Cut. When we clamor for better multi tasking in the iPad we have to come up with the use case that involves the pencil if we want to see those developments take shape right now the same way Tim shared that enterprise applications are driving Vision OS development."
Magic Mouse ERGONOMICS!!! LOL Loved your poker face Marques! That had to be hard to hold.
"Tim made Apple bigger and more successful. Amazing that you can write to him and get a response. Yes, maybe not from him, but you get an answer."
"marques só faz as perguntas certas, é incrível. e mais incrível foi ver o cook se esquivando do joguinho no final 😂"
This is legendary
You can tell that Marques held back laughter when talking about the Magic Mouse
i love how you guys went close up to Tim when asked about the magic mouse. golden
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> when he says 15 😂😂"
Did Tim dirty with the magic 🐁
I couldn&#39;t figure out why Tim Cook sounded so weird until I realized it wasn&#39;t actually Riley Murdoch.
I almost clapped when he said magic mouse but then I remembered why my wrist actually hurt
MAGIC MOUSE was so ergonomically magic that I had it disappear from my desk for a real ergonomic upright mouse.
Tim Cook kinda looked like Biden a little when thinking about the magic mouse 🤣
who still uses a vision pro on a daily basis?
Why even post an interview where all the questions are looked over before hand?? no real questions just a lot of BS
One thing I hate about companies in general is that when they don&#39;t know the history of their products. How do you work in a company when you don&#39;t know your products?
bro actually just didnt rank them
workouts done! those circles in the fitness app ALL FULL! 💪👏
Yeah!
Was it just me or did this interview sound scripted
Anyone else think about how Tim has close all three rings before the interview
"MK: Rank these from 1-5<br>Me: let’s see how he calls them all amazing<br>Tim: this is great, that is great, everything is great! 😏"
Tim Cook is one of animal crossing character’s name
"“Let the past die, kill it if you have to” - Tim"
Maybe the iPad is so beefed up with no purpose because Tim can’t live without his.
Tim Cook is unprepared for this interview. Very underwhelmed by this—hope he’s okay.
You can tell he doesn&#39;t like the Magic Mouse at all. lol
Great interview!
"you can read Marques thoughts so vividly about the Magic mouse, and Tim HAD to chose this answer, and he did politically well. the worst are ALL the little tiny willy entitled kids crying about a charging port, and making it life threatening, proving they have a massively borings American existence!"
Seems a lot of people don’t understand what ergonomics means by using the charging port as an example
Tims media training in full effect 😂
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=562"">9:22</a>, such a great statement :)"
"Marques, you were being a smart a.. with the Magic Mouse, you were taking the piss. We all see what you did there 😂"
"@marques Brownlee.   As a viewer, how do I respond to this video?  I like the interview but I dislike the guest’s responses to the questions.   Do I “like” the video, or do I “dislike’ the video because I disagree with the guest’s responses.  Just wondering on how it would affect your analytics/."
I didn’t realize Tim could afford a Vision Pro. Good for him :)
wood behind that arrow
The very best interview Marques! Legendary.
Tim has always been great to listen to. He has interesting insights and has always put Apple as #1 on his list. Great CEO.
"audio seems a bit proccessed, anyone else??"
Good interview!
markus brownie 🤤🤤 come 2 bRazil!!! 🥦🥦🦕🦕
"Really Marques, apple doesn’t send anything to cloud keeps everything on device. Are you familiar with iCloud?"
And uhhhhh
Let Tim Cook
I&#39;d like to see the hands of the Apple ergonomics team that worked on the Magic Mouse...
"Marques trying to do a tight 15 and Tim Apple, ironically, reminiscing by looking back"
Best of the Tim Cook interviews by a mile
"The slight zoom-in on the important questions ... I see you Mariah Zenk, and the studio team!! &lt;3"
Tim Cook isn’t cookin 🗣️
"Well what did we miss that you got to see, the event I got to watch was 1hr 43 min long and not the 2 hours you talked about! Maybe you can tell us what we missed. 🤔"
Tim doesn&#39;t sound as confident as Steve was.
Tim is so real. You know it&#39;s got to be hard to do something that really blows his mind at this point.
Excellent content. Super glad to see this channel getting this kind of attention.
Tim Cook is awesome. Let’s not see him with suspicion.  has done so much for our world today and will continue into the future.
Bro has no spirit
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=550"">9:10</a> his viewpoint of legacy is incredibly interesting"
Bro has 0 aura
Marques I would like it if you could interview Elon on this subject. He’s got a real beef with it.
There is no emoji to express my feelings
magic Mouse <br><br>I take this personally
Did this mf just say that ergonomics was a focus when creating the Magic Mouse
Just scrolled several pages of the top comments. EVERY SINGLE ONE is about the Magic Mouse. Kind of embarrassing that y&#39;all focus on that when he talked about so many things. I love my MM and think y&#39;all are pretty lame dissing it over the charge port on the bottom. Have used one ever since they came out and I can only think of one time it ran out of juice on me. Plug it in once a month when you go to bed. And you&#39;ll be golden. Move on and talk about important stuff.
I just imagine Tim sweating every time Marques asks a cheeky question 😂
The magic mouse is anything but ergonomic.
"Good to have these talks, and subtly hold tech leaders accountable!"
Hahaha so this was a really great interview. But that magic mouse response was amazing. He clearly forgot what it was or just had a really hard time saying ANYTHING good about it. Calling it ergonomic is absolutely hilarious
Tim is talking about privacy and my Iphone 12Pro max Face ID opening with my younger brother face 😂😂 <br><br>Ps:he is 6 years younger and we are totally not looking like each other
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=651"">10:51</a> &quot;The most popular laptop in the world is the MacBook Air...&quot;, such a misleading statement. It&#39;s true, BY MODEL, the MacBook Air is the most sold laptop. But Apple makes like 3 laptops. Look at the real picture, and BY BRAND, for 2023, Lenovo took 24.8%, HP 21.9%, Dell 16.6%, and then Apple at 9.0%<br><br>I work in IT and know how many laptops are bought for doing actual work at a business, and no one is buying Apples unless your in media.<br><br>I don&#39;t hate Apple, I own stock, but they are always trying to dumb things down for people and taking credit for other inventors accomplishments with overpriced hardware. I don&#39;t blame someone for wanting to pay more for less thinking, but it&#39;s not for me."
tim is cooked
What a dry CEO. Who’s next in line?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> was a pivotal moment in Marques’ career. Lean into the meme, chuckle because “ergonomics” or stay professional and continue interviewing this Titan of industry. If you look closely, he managed to do both."
Common case of a ceo being a representative and not directly involved in product development process . Can hear it in the way he speaks. No technical lingo.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> Okay Marques, what do you know about the next iPhone 🧐 You can tell us, we will keep it a secret 🤫"
Bro made Tim say AI.
"It would have been interesting to have included the Apple II in the blind ranking.  Enjoyed the interview, thanks 🙏"
I’m confused. Which one is Cook Tim?
I felt like I just wasted 15 minutes of my time. Good politician Tim
I love Tim I think he’s done great for Apple. He’s a down home Alabama boy and he’s innovative.
unfortunately i can&#39;t enjoy those new features this summer. my iphone is most of the time TOO HOT to run.
fix Siri
That zoom in on the Crook was REAL!! Almost &quot;magic&quot;.. one might say.
This is a huge &quot;get&quot; getting to interview Tim. But can we take a moment to discuss Tim&#39;s groovy socks? :-)
Does an apple video using an apple phone for notes....being careful this time
long story short : the stuff that Steve Jobs did : HUGGGE ... things that Tim did ... mehhh
Tim is shaking. Did they over work him?
Every Android user just want to accept  the company is good only if they make it first well..... Apple doesn&#39;t intend to be the first but the best... 😅... <br>If you saying that&#39;s already on Android just know apple did the Apple way
"When Marques mention the Magic Mouse, Tim cook got blanked and the face of Marques is like he is trolling him. lol"
tim looks hot
Tim is an awesome human.
You look like a Ken doll on your thumbnail
MKBHD: rank Vision Pro<br>Tim: my parents are dead
"MKBHD with the 200 IQ move by wearing and using iPhone products with Tim Cook meeting. If MKBHD used different products such as Samsung or Google, I am sure Tim would give a different vibe with intense glare and sweat a little"
Iconic interview. The sheer diplomacy of Tim apple answering his own version of each question. Pure politician. I would have been shocked if he had actually given rankings
i don&#39;t know how to explain it but this interview is just so weird to me!
this feels like an ad
I love how Tim ignored the blind ranking and said the Magic Mouse has the right ergonomics. 😂☠️
"How could you not say the iPod. The stock was horrendously low and if it weren’t for the iPod, they wouldn’t have had the funding to produce the iPhone. All 1-5 can say thank you to the iPod. Cmon marques"
"Thank you, we will soon have a better Magic Mouse thanks to this interview lol."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=393"">6:33</a> - that was very powerful and I don’t think I’ve ever heard a giant company leader speak with that certainty before."
"I don’t know how on earth Marques was able to hold that poker face when he asked about how he would rank the magic mouse and Cook started touting its ergonomics; that charging design is objectively flawed and outdated, but he kept it respectful! Laughed pretty hard at that point with the zoom in’s: “Mhmm…&quot;"
Tim cook: The ergonomics<br>MKBHD: Ok 🙂🙂🙂
Congrats to MKBHD on the Tim Cook interview 👏😎<br><br>Is it me or does it seem as if Tim has lost some of the sharpness?
Interviewing the biggest CEO in the tech world: no problem.<br><br>Keeping a straight face talking about the magic mouse: 😰😰
"Even TIm think the magic mouse is a crap hahaha, was obviously that he hate it."
You could tell Tim was sweating. Knowing all of the power Marques has in his hands over companies. I can&#39;t imagine the pressure.
I’m curious if Apple PR had requested the interview questions in advance or had Marques agree to avoid certain topics?  Yes and Yes.
Marques when Tim is talking about Apple mouse ergonomics 🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=437"">7:17</a> Marques trying so hard to keep a straight face"
"@Marques Brownlee Next time ask the hard question, why they wont let the user install MacOS on iPad pro&#39;s?"
MKBHD “Next we’ll do a blind ranking”<br>Tim - no I don’t think we will
"Apple may have been using artificial intelligence for a long time, but it’s been known for being fairly unintelligent for a long time."
"Tim Cook : the walking , talking PR machine"
Tim Cook: mentions ergonomics and Magic Mouse<br><br>MKBHD: holding back his laughter harder than that interviewer with Jojo Siwa
He definitely mentioned the Magic Mouse to get him thinking about a new design
Tim spoke really badly I felt. Was rambling onto nothing and was so slow with his speech.
Maybe this is why MB will never say anything damaging about Apple ever.. just due to his immense access
"Thanks Tim Apple, very cool!"
4-	The emergence of AI and its necessities<br>@jamshidi_rahim
I am confused. What&#39;s funny about the magic mouse? Does it not exist or what?
Marques Brownlee is the BEST!
The blind ranking was genius
This AI is all BS
i feel bad for Tim Cook by Marques mentioning AI at the very first few seconds on the video
You can tell he’s also not proud of the Magic Mouse. I’m upset that marques didn’t ask him about why the iPad OS announcements were such a disappointment.
Tims been media trained well. Marques asks him “how” privacy will be implemented with AI and Tim responds with the most nothing burger response I’ve ever heard.
We are focused on privacy... 🤣
Idk what people are listening but I find the most answers of Tim to be on the topic and satisfactory
Marques: &quot;So we&#39;re going to do a blind ranking&quot;<br>Tim: &quot;No we&#39;re not&quot;<br>Marques: &quot;That&#39;s correct I meant we&#39;re not doing a blind ranking&quot;<br>Tim: &quot;Yeah&quot;
"I like the direction Apple is going. They’ve been very responsive whenever I’ve had any issue and get on it immediately or make it right without much resistance. I can say I see myself being a life-long Apple customer and I look forward to what is coming soon to my devices. I use a M1 MacBook Air, 13 inch M4 IPad Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I like how everything just works together smoothly and I don’t have to worry about if a note is saved to this drive or that device; it’s all on cloud. You can’t get such an easy and smooth experience out of other ecosystems."
Sorry but WHAT ARE those SOCKS?
"Loved the interview Marcus, and especially enjoyed seeing Tim consider what he was going to say about the “Magic mouse”. 🤔"
Wheres the Airpods Max 2 at?
"The pan to Marques&#39; pain after that &quot;ergonomics&quot; bomb, excellent camera work!"
I agree with Elon.
I am sure hes gonna push for a newer mouse in the coming years
"private cloud compute, PCC… hmm CCP?? <b>puts on tin foil hat</b>"
"Play the game, Tim!"
Did he just say getting the ergonomics with the Magic Mouse was key? 😂😂😂 ok Goodnight
modern big shot CEO is basically a politician
A whole lot of nothin’. Tim is the perfect complement to Apples frenetic self obsession with his folksy Texas mannerisms. Generative AI is theft. Full stop.
I&#39;m 100% sure you could live without iPad.
"Marques was like: hey tim, look!! I’m using an iPhone 🤳"
This was a PR masterclass.
"I&#39;ve heard so many impersonations of Tim, but this is the first time I&#39;ve actually heard the man himself."
Facebook took the name meta verse Apple said we will take A.I
You knew what you were doing with that Magic Mouse quip 🤣🤣🤣
he did NOT understand the ranking game at the end AT ALL LOL. sadly very out of touch but tbf he&#39;s old and MB didn&#39;t explain the game well. tim def thought MB was ranking the products himself and was prob so confused over putting the magic mouse over the the freaking iPhone lol
What diaect does &quot;eckstablished&quot; belong to?
Private Cloud Compute
Your ability at interviewing is a wonderful thing to see. What a moment.
I’m curious if there will be a system setting that will disable OpenAI in general so you don’t get a prompt and have to say NO all the time.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=320"">5:20</a> anyone notice tim could tell that the phone was/wasn&#39;t the 15? def says something about him or the phone. mostly something about him because he didn&#39;t just logically assume the most popular youtube tech creator of all time would have the newest iPhone. like hello? out of touch much? also he prob subconsciously thinks a rich tech reviewers cant afford his phones lol. just so many out of touch vibes"
This isn’t even me but watch this channel from the beginning till now. Congratulations
"I could see it in his eyes, he wanted to ask about the bottom of the mouse."
When Tim thought Marques might not have the latest iPhone 😅
Marques&#39; face when Tim is talking about the Magic Mouse is golden.
"Unfortunately, Tim isn’t an innovative, risk-taking CEO. He focuses more on a defensive strategy and maintaining the company’s existing strengths."
"mr cook excel at speaking, his language is very easy to understand"
He really put him on the spot with the whole Magic Mouse thing 😭😂
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=872"">14:32</a> “i use it for the entertainment value” right.. 😂"
Tim “Cooked”
&quot;we&#39;ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices...&quot; lmao
MB: Magic Mouse<br>TC:… it was also an incredible moment…<br>MB: <b>DOUBTFACE</b>
The iPOD should have been part of the ranking too .. thoughts 🙄
He struggled to be positive about the Magic Mouse.
Mentioning ‘ergonomics’ and ‘magic mouse in the same sentence is insane
magic mouse oh my .. 🤣
"I have almost all Apple Products, that&#39;s how much of an Apple fanboy I am, but even I gotta disagree with Tim about the Magic Mouse. It&#39;s ergonomics are really bad. I use it for stuff like surfing the internet, or watching YouTube, but the moment I start editing videos or playing games, I switch off of it cause I don&#39;t want to use it for the next few hours."
"Marques is full of details. He put out his iPhone on this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=186"">3:06</a>. The previous one he was with a S24 Ultra. Classy move."
"Wait, &quot;dub dub&quot; is a real pronunciation?! 🤦‍♂️"
"i wont lie, its hard to listen to this guys PR trained BS. wish MB was more assertive and actually got an answer for most of these Qs but we all know we would not even get these interviews if he was."
a.i is the Trojan horse
no one seems to realise we have been paying for apple’s experiments… got to give it to them… real smart…
Relevant and pointed questions! Great interview sir. I look forward to more.
10/10
"Should have asked a one last question, “what does your phones home screen look like”"
Ergonomics
"&quot;So I&#39;d like to close with one last question Tim, how fast can you type the alphabet?&quot;"
Very political answers.
Honestly was expecting them to announce the split screen feature but still nothing shem
I bet Tim doesn&#39;t cook.
"Not sure why, i don&#39;t feel this is a interview session, it like interrogation session to me."
This video makes me realize that Samsung needs a face of the company. We don&#39;t associate anyone with Samsung like Tim Cook is with Apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> showing Marques&#39;s face when Tim said &quot;getting the ergonomics right&quot; is WIIIIIILD😂 like! what ergonomics, Tim? that thing charges underneath!"
I came here expecting I would learn absolutely nothing new. I was not disappointed.
I wanna know what Marques thought when Tim said ergonomics and magic mouse in the same sentence 😂
"Great interview! But I have to correct Tim on one thing: when the iPhone was launched, there was a program to admit students to the annual Worldwide Developer&#39;s Conference. But it was limited: they had to apply months in advance, submit samples of their work, and hope to be among the 500 selected. But the number of Apple developers was still limited, membership was expensive, and the addressable market only a fraction of the PC world. The iPhone changed everything."
MKBHD is so huge here that it feels like Tim Cook is interviewing him instead. Super proud of MKHBD and how far he has come without compromising his integrity
same feeling when you&#39;re trying to wiggle yourself out of a speeding ticket. the magic mouse.
MKBHD: That’s a very LeBron answer <br>Tim: <b>confused</b> ah is that right ?😅<br>😂
Is the small amount of access granted really worth the trade off of Marques&#39; platform being used as essentially a corporate mouthpiece? Future impartiality called in to question just to ask some pre approved soft ball questions?
The look on Marques&#39; face when Tim mentioned &quot;ergonomics&quot; in the same sentence as the &quot;magic mouse&quot;🤣
"I knew Marques was good at Ultimate Frisbee, but who knew he was so good at SOFTBALL. lol"
Magic Mouse! <br>Tim: You cheeky lil bastard Marcus.
Hearing Tim Cappuccino Apple have the same accent as my aunt from Arkansas was sort of strange.
"Honestly this interview is an interview as it should. It’s respectful, but challenging enough for Tim in a way that makes it an interesting conversation. Others I saw just felt like marketing content. Congrats."
Tim cooked the questions
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> a simple wrong word would’ve tanked Apple 😂"
lmao the face that Marques makes when Tim mentions ergonomics and magic mouse at the same time is priceless XD
Marques has come such a long way 😊
"sorry. tokeme forevert to find the new youtube komment, im stopping now this is nor working"
Apple is a BS company lol. Tim talks in circles.
"I really like keeping everything on device as much as possible, and I hope that continues in the future (and for generative models to go on device as soon as possible too)."
WAR EAGLE Tim!
Sad to see MKBHD lower himself to this level.
Marques side smile asking about the magic mouse
Marques saying &quot;ok&quot; aftter the magic mouse being &quot;ergonomic&quot; lol
Marcus for next apple ceo!!!!!
Imagine the headline “Tim cook ranks Magic Mouse last among Apple products”
Such a hypocrite ! He just speak to... Say nothing !
If George Carlin were still alive he would file the therm &quot;Private Cloud Compute&quot; into his grotesque evasions folder.
Cook is straight stumbling over his words doesn’t even actually know if it’ll work
mk! you can change the title to &quot;Roasting Tim cook&quot;
He had to say that about the Magic Mouse. Good question
"i lasted a minute - twenty seconds.<br>Ya, no ... same as everyone else &quot;opportunity for a whole new curve of tech&quot;, <br>&quot;providing and doing more for people&quot; ... gobbeldy-gook ... im out."
I just hope that Tim got confused with a new Magic Mouse they&#39;&#39;re designing haha
That was both fascinating and brutal to watch at the same time
I love that not even Tim Cook could tell which iPhone MKB had
"Ugh marques is so ballsy with his questions, such a clear indication of why he is the very best at what he does, I have so much respect for him!"
Tim just cooks and waffles a lot without actually saying anything
Pride parade tim
so So SO much spin. Deecnt job of pushing him a little under duress and no doubt restricted.
Who benefits more from this interview?
"[Takes Dramamine tablet...]<br><br>Ok, ready to listen to Timothy Donald Cook for 20 minutes."
Give JiDion his airpods back
That video where you see the comment section first!
Magic Mouse and ergonomics ? Shut up!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=364"">6:04</a> expansion"
Bro really went speechless when he mentioned the Magic Mouse 😭
I feel like when Tim puts his hands or fingertips together—it’s more or less about to sound like an Apple plug lol just my thought haha
Our objective is to be best: USBC had to be forced.
Tim swerved that blind ranking
Man i swear you have came so far from reviewing htc one to having actual &quot;podcast talk&quot; with tim is super crazy 🎉 good for you doggie
"“Our objective isn’t to be the first, our objective is to be the best” - such a strong quote, especially when people talk about Apple being behind on features. ❤"
"the easy to explain from the old saying, how to apply a network tree into our daily life"
Every single answer Tim Apple gives in that slimey corporate language makes my skin itch. <br>Marques on the other hand is most relatable guy in the tech world right now.
I feel like apple’s holding a gun to the back of MKB’s head during this entire interview 😂
Are Tim&#39;s bottom teeth jacked up?
This interview puts to rest any rumors about the Magic Mouse redesign since Tim believes it already has perfect ergonomics 🤦‍♂️
Someone save me time: is this worth watching or is Tim Cook giving boring answers?
Only thing that comes to mind is Riley&#39;s impersonation of Tim .
The smile on Marques&#39; face after asking about Magic mouse is GOLD. 🤣🤣
"I assume that you were only allowed to ask certain questions. Something that would really improve my life is RCS, Not AI. this is the man that once said to someone buy your mum an iPhone. what about people that can&#39;t afford an iPhone. when you become wealthy you forget that there are people that are really struggling. They talk about privacy, however when I send someone a text on android, everyone can see my texts."
Apple simp
tell tim he needs to do an interview with theo von next
What will Musk think about Apple private and Chat GPT
Tim:  I can’t believe this guy has more followers than Apple but didn’t notice I was wearing Apple glasses!
Why do I feel like even Tim Cook is not using the magic mouse. 😂
Bro is not getting invited again 😭
Was the interview mandate that you had to floss their hardware during the conversation? 😆 <br><br>Solid interview.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> did Tim Cook not recognize which Iphone that was? I wouldn&#39;t either, they all look the same."
"Imagine if Marques had an interview with Steve Jobs, Tim seems like a nice and smart guy and he is sure doing a great job, but Steve had charisma, and he loved design and products way more."
"You just see how full of c%$ Tim Cook is about the most unergonomic device, the MagicMouse. He says it was so important for us to get the ergonomics right. Marques&#39;s face is priceless. It&#39;s just a pity that he did not push back a bit."
Im not really sure if Tim knows what hes talking about when speaking on his own products
Tim Apple
Did anyone noticed the gentle zoom effect with he started talking about the &quot;Magic mouse&quot; 😅... that was on purpose 😅
&quot;The magic mouse?&quot; <b>camera zooms in</b> i was like  👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Did he really say that’s a LeBron answer? Or is that something that LeBron should be saying about his legacy?
"This was the longest and most boring apple commercial I have ever watched. Tim isn&#39;t giving real answers, hes calculating the proper marketing answer. 0 respect for someone who can&#39;t be real."
"Marques, the kid doing his first product review, now, talking with Apple CEO. What a ride."
the lighting on this set and the camera set up makes your skin glow wonderfully!
TIM COOKS is a sneaky fox...
Marques’s reaction to Tim’s reaction to Magic Mouse was priceless
“Magic Mouse” Marquess you are a savage! 😂🤣
Why didn&#39;t Tim just say they wanted something that looked pretty? That&#39;s the only reason people buy the magic mouse in the first place
Answers feels like someone trying to get a 5 in an Spanish Exam without studing
magic mouse 😂😂😂😂😂
I can tell you why people use iphones less than android variants.<br><br>Because they don&#39;t get the texts from android users. Iphones are so much fail.
8 hours ago and 1M view! mkbhd at the top of the tech reviewers🔥⚡️💪🏻
Dammit Tim ! Stop giving Biden when you talk about your product! 😭😭
He straight up refused to blind rank haha. Such an alpha move.
"“I couldn’t live without my iPad today” -and you only missed the calculator now?!😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=726"">12:06</a>"
this was a confusing and hilarious interview as well 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=944"">15:44</a> <br>It&#39;s like watching an AI or a robot 🤖 🤔 that is now learning about Apple 🍎 products 😮😢"
Tim does not come across well here man.
"Tim, if you see this, please focus on creating a new Magic Mouse. 🙏"
i don&#39;t want these cynical videos marques
Where&#39;s his s24 ultra for the interview?!
This interview made me think less of Apple… Tim Cook’s replies are very strange. It’s a lot of words with really little information.
Bro let his intrusive thoughts loose 😂
"A lot of people talking about how the interview was &quot;tense&quot;, honestly it doesn&#39;t seem like Tim is hesitating, cause all the questions end up answered anyway. I&#39;d imagine he&#39;s tired. A whole day of these interviews will tire you out."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=871"">14:31</a> MKBHD: What do you use Vision Pro for?<br>Tim Cook: ahhhhhh….."
"Tims words: &quot;we want to empower you to be able to do things you couldn&#39;t do otherwise&quot;<br>Tims meaning: &quot;we pretend we invented everything, then trap you in our ecosystem so you don&#39;t choose to do the same things on android&quot;"
The magic mouse lmao you got tim good on that one.
"Privacy is a concern with generative AI, but it is hardly the only concern people have with AI. Apple does have a good, if not perfect, record with privacy, so Tim focused on that, but what about concerns such as the training data that LLMs use? Hallucinations? Heck, even the poor aesthetics of generated images.<br><br>I know you have to walk a fine line for access to interviews with Tim Cook, but I&#39;d like to have seen some kind of question or follow-up about generative AI that wasn&#39;t simply about privacy."
Tim dodged a bullet by avoiding ranking his products.
“How so?”<br><br>Great question for an interviewer ask. He’s such a good interviewer.
He’s weirdly a lot talking about privacy
"So, this guy is just a name and a face for the biggest company in the world. 😮😢<br>Apple, please choose a fan who knows your history and your products to be the face and voice we want to see 👀 and hear. 😊 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=696"">11:36</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> - 🤣🤣 Tim is waffling lol, Marques making him sweat 💦"
Marques knew exactly what he was doing when he mentioned the Magic Mouse lol
It&#39;s difficult to see Tim cook without a script....
The magic mouse doesn’t have to do nothing with ergonomics 😂
Help! I&#39;ve rolled my eyes so hard during this interview that I&#39;m now blind!
Tim speaks in Ultra HD
these softball interviews are embarassing.
Audio sounds interesting. Wonder what they used to record it.
끊임없는 추구
"Great interview, Marques. You have a good style for these, I’d love to see more one-on-one interviews."
I like Tim Cook but the Magic Mouse moment killed me 😂
I can&#39;t decide if bringing up the magic mouse was brilliant or a low blow lol.
wtf tim socks are those
&quot;Use our phone less because of how well the intelligence works&quot; is an interesting way to put it while asking Tim.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=178"">2:58</a> - naa it was probably off the table for privacy reasons until Tim realised shit this is the future and everyone is on it, f privacy for now we’ll think how to deal with it but AI is on baby!"
Tim is cheating on the game. Everything was #1
Ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 🐭 . Your smirk was hilarious.😂
"&quot;And Tim, our last question will be asked by a longtime Apple fan, please welcome to the stage: LOUIS ROSSMANN!&quot;"
"Tim stop match donations to friends of I D F ! If you’re a citizen of this world with genuine ethics, then please stop these donations! Peace!!"
You gotta love the editor to zoom right at Marques and Tim’s face when their talking about the Magic Mouse is priceless 🤣🙌🏽
Why did you have to do him like that on the Magic Mouse ?? Lmao😂
The cutting when you talked about the Magic Mouse is premium. Amazingly done guys
"So, tim likes multiple monitors"
But how lucky is he to have a sit down with MKBHD
that&#39;s insane video quality 🔥
I honestly think he did not even know what the magic mouse is
🤣😂🤣😂🤣  Dude take your friends iPhone with you shut it off on the Interview But for what&#39;s hid face tried to grab it and find out it was a MICKEY MOUSE WHOOOOOOAAAA
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=105"">1:45</a> - so basically what they’re trying to do is keep the user clueless about the technology they’re using, or what it is or how it works. They want the user to focus on the benefit and the product, that’s why they always come up with some fancy names for a new technology they add to their products."
Interesting you asked him about his legacy then you ask him about top 5 products and the one done under his reign vision pro only time will tell if it has the acclaim the other 4 had.
Lmao his face when Tim says magic mouse and ergonomics in one sentence
The seriousness at the Magic Mouse moment. Killed me.
"things that improve peoples lives, now at just $1999"
"Damn the answer about legacy was so good - Basically idgaf, not gonna worry for things that I don&#39;t control 😂"
Marques trying to hold it together at the &quot;ergonomics&quot; of the magic mouse around 12m10s is killing me. The little breath before he comments and then that sad downward glance 😂😂😂
I love how the camera was especially zoomed in when Tim awkwardly talks about Magic Mouse while MKBHD was trying to hide his slight evil smile.
"apple used to be my favourite company, innovative and cutting edge. now i could not be less interested or excited. same shit every year, OUR BEST YET. no innovation. yet the worlds richest company. L for design innovation"
"I had a play around with the Magic Mouse in one of Apple&#39;s Stores and it&#39;s awful, stick with Logitech MX series."
This is awesome. Happy for you man
Guys stop the delusion. Tim didn’t do this for Marques….. he’s doing marketing and the first one to speak with him was iJustine. Her video was uploaded over a day ago…… oh and he gave the same answers to marques as he did to Justine. It’s funny if you’ve watched hers as well. You’ll notice it immediately 😂😂😂😂
The zoom at the magic mouse mart was the sneakiest sarcasm ever
"He wants to b like Steve Jobs so bad, and he&#39;s not even close"
1. iPhone<br>2. Macbook Air<br>3. iPad<br>4. Vision pro<br>5. Mouse
That slow zoom in when he asked about Magic mouse was spot on 😂.
apple rocks!
All I wanted was to hear him talk about the iPad calculator Marques indirectly created
Tim is wearing Apple rainbow colored socks.
How would you feel Marques if Steve Jobs were alive and sitting here giving the interview instead of Tim?
what would&#39;ve been so bad about doing a real blind ranking? give the people what they want Tim!
Legit good interview
Great interview and both guys rock. The ergonomics zoom into Marques was the best things ever lol
nice PR video .... 😅
"Shazzam annaa ithoke kanunundo<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/location-yellow-teal-bars""></a>"
Can you stop your contacts generating images of yourself?
What a SNOOZE conversation
Time for Craig Federighi to be CEO.
Marques look when he heard &quot; getting the ergonomics ......&quot; 😅
Tim Apple is the most &quot;Good Morning&quot; typa person I&#39;ve ever seen💀
No talk about the future of AR or VR?
&quot;My Dinner with Satan&quot;
Jensen Huang next?
The face of marques when tim says magic mouse has good ergonomics 😂
Tim closed his rings
"Decent questions, but no real answers. Just staying on brand I s&#39;pose...."
do you have to pre-screen your questions before an interview like this?
"I’m sure this will be a super transparent and forward coming interview , yes"
"I can&#39;t really rectify Tim&#39;s comment that their products don&#39;t require engagement to succeed, but rather it&#39;s a tool to open new possibilities (paraphrased). Adding new features directly results in more use time, if those features are intended to replace their predecessors. See the camera, the TV, the MP3 player, the map..."
The ergonomics?!?!??! Girrrlll
63 year old man with no kids likes to use his vision pro to look at his dead parents. sad.
Magic mouse redesign in 2025 due to tbis video. MKBHD single-handedly cor ered them into it. Calling it now.
"this is what influencers do, hope marques can influence tim to make a new mouse :)"
Lmao the look on Marquees when Tim spoke on the Magic Mouse
I am an Apple customer and this video is basically publicity. No question about the excess of power with iPad and weak software? The possibility of integrating MacOS on IPad? For example … what a waste of opportunity. Shame.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=869"">14:29</a> I&#39;m pretty sure he don&#39;t use it 😂"
That curved ball of Magic Mouse :D
bro forgot his own product called magic mouse
"One of the greatest products created by Apple is the Magic Mouse! Completely changed the speed and efficiency of almost everything! I could live without my iPad, iPhone but never my Magic Mouse…"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=871"">14:31</a> only time he covered his mouth was talking about VisionPro. Telling…"
It would have been great if Marques had brought his Samsung phone instead of the iPhone 😂 Wouldn&#39;t it? 😅🌝
Magic Mouse really bro 😂 he trollin
So much BS from Tim. He&#39;s not natural at all. Awkward...
Marques Brownlee should be the new CEO of Apple.
He reminds me of Jack Barker from TV-Show Silicon Valley! Can we count how many times he just repeats same stuff.
I really liked that interview. Great Job Marques!
He didn&#39;t answer anything...
Marques had come a long way in the last couple years with these types of interviews. Very thought out questions! Great work. Enjoyed it.
That Magic Pokerface 😂😂
"OH boy, Magic Mouse?  How about the SE/30? Or the Mac 128K."
So cool to see Tim Cook in a non-presentation mode :D
Am assuming this interview took place before Elon Mush went all juvenile on Apple/OpenAI on twitter otherwise would have been interesting for Marques to ask Tim on the Musk pseudo meltdown and the disinformation he&#39;s spreading.
Awesome
“The magic mouse… Uuhhhh. It was also an incredible moment.” <br>- Tim Cook
Fun fact: Tim Cook doesn’t know what a Magic Mouse is
"Magic mouse - Incredible, In what multi verse ?"
Tim is getting old.
Tim apple
There&#39;s this unwritten rules which says you gotta hold an iPhone while interviewing Tim Cook
Is Marques this generation&#39;s Walt Mossberg?
"Tim trying so hard to defend the Magic Mouse is definitely a trait of a good CEO, get you a leader that will defend even your worst mistakes"
You knew what you were doing when you put the magic mouse on the list 😂😂 absolutely priceless 😂
The fact that Tim Cook did not know what the Magic mouse says a lot about how little effort was put into designing it by the company 😂.
I dont trust this man.
The Magic Mouse moment got Tim Cook out of the world reminding what can be said! It was great seeing Marques interviewing the CEO-giant!🍎
&quot;Getting the ergonomics well done... was key.&quot;<br>&quot;With magic mouse?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>&quot;Okay...&quot;
"TC says “You decide” … yeah, like we decide to agree to Big Tech’s Terms and Conditions. It’s like deciding whether to breath or not."
"The level of executive media training by Cook is, just, impressive…"
Marques is incredible and Apple Should Make Him there Top Man because of his talent and vision
I will not be surprised if the next iteration of magic mouse comes out next year
"Any idea why Marques is stifling a laugh at around the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> mark?"
conversing with ChatGPT be like:
It was great fun… not.
Magic 🪄 mouse 🐁 😂😂
&quot;The magic mouse&quot; ... *quick think of something vague to say*....
I laugh on Magic Mouse LOL
Woahhh now that&#39;s an exclusive
"Tim: we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. <br>MKBHQ: Except in China of course. <br>Tim: Right, except in China. Anyway…<br><br>Great conversation."
Certified Apple Tech here: Nobody in tech really uses Apple devices.
The private cloud explanation was a masterclass in saying a lot of words that didn&#39;t even remotely answer the question 😂.
"Tim said everything and nothing at the same time. My goodness, he is a veteran at CEO/media speak."
"Marques went FULL SEND! Boy is cooking. You never fail to deliver, to more epic interviews sir 👏🏼✨💯🫶🏼"
"It is so cool when I see Marcus, avoiding eye contact with the person being interviewed, I think I would do the same, I would not know where to look😅"
there goes your security with OpenAI all your data will be wisked away and you&#39;ll have no choice.
"If Apple makes a foldable phone, Samsung is dead, their z fold 4, and z fold 5 are garbage their hinges break easily,  hinges get stuck easily the inner breaks easily and the port to plug in the type c cable theirs a warning loud sound of dust or overheating when theirs nothing inside the port"
"Apple Intelligence is the lamest naming ever. Apple always wants to be in the spotlight, and this latest attempt is so, so childish"
I like that Marques actually asked real questions not like iJustine where she was just sucking up to Tim
Marques Brownlee is a very clever and fair guy. Absolute honest in his point of view and this his great value.
"Tech YouTubers on WWDC: Nifty neato!<br>MKBHD: Tim, Imma need a word with you about all this.<br>Tim: Yes sir!"
I thought he was doing a pretty good job of avoiding lame corporate answers until the game at the end. Just be honest. Have some fun. Geeeez
"Tim Apple is like the most stereotypical CEO in his speech pattern, answers and dress. Makes sense though, it&#39;s a lot of responsibility to be the boss of a $3,300,000,000,000 value company"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a> marques trying to not laugh with that deep breathing lol"
this is more like cooking AI 🙂 as in Apple Intelligence
Have they addressed the noise charging. Like come on why
Didn’t they release a book reminiscing about all their old products?
"Nah, I do agree Magic Mouse has room to improve, but hating Magic Mouse is big hands people with 5 hours focus time people kind of thing. I finally got one and it’s not what these internet people talk about at all 😂"
Tim cook saying that the ergonomics are the best thing about Magic Mouse is a troll in itself 😂
Let Tim Cook 🧑‍🍳🗣️🔥
He is like talking to a recorder
You really earned this @MKBHD and the same goes for @apple ❤️
I&#39;m with Tim Cook here. What the hell is a blind ranking?
Somehow he reminds me of Biden 😂
"When is Siri going to understand when I speak one or other language, and read back to me a text in the language that was written?"
"Kudos, Marques, for pushing him outside the box with the game 🙌 It was very interesting and a lot of fun!"
I was hoping for Marques or iJustine to ask more practical questions like why the M4 iPad is still completely crippled by a useless OS… but I guess the Apple ninjas were on standby to silence any questions that might put Apple in a negative light…
"Epic Marques. Congrats! Talking about legacy and history, with this interview you just did it! I&#39;m looking forward to watch this video again in 10 years time."
like how marques brought out an iphone for this interview
"Software is great. AI and all that. <br>And I really love Apple but why &quot;privacy is fundamental human right&quot;, while repairability seems to be not, at least not anymore. Especially considering luxury price. I really can&#39;t get it.<br>In previous WWDCs Apple had all those big words about saving the planet, carbon-neutral, all those environment-friendly stuff.<br>How does unrepairable device help to achieve that goal?<br>Right now Framework&#39;s laptops are really breakthrough, while Apple&#39;s giving us glued all-together unrepairable good-looking piece of .... packed with MacOS (<br>Nuts."
i felt that legacy part
"To be fair, Tim&#39;s probably got a lot more on his plate to worry about the Magic Mouse these days xD. He&#39;s certainly not going to trash it, he obviously didn&#39;t know what to say."
Magic Mouse actually is great!
"Every interview from Steve Jobs was a masterclass. Still relevant today. Visionary. Sorry, but I do not see vision or leader here. A great manager. That&#39;s it. One of the few things Steve Jobs failed; his succession."
I live for that magic ✨ mouse question. Brilliant Brownlee!
"Marques&#39;s hero&#39;s journey from a teenager in his bedroom creating a review because nobody else had made one, to exclusive interviews with the CEO of the worlds most valuable company. Incredible."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=165"">2:45</a> It would be pretty funny if you used an Android."
"the moment of the CEO is almost forgot the product, it&#39;s literally showed on his face when heard the Magic Mouse 🤣🤣"
"Keep in mind “people” means *shareholders*, when Tim says “people” wanted Apple to have an AI-focus."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=576"">09:36</a> &quot;I never look back, darling, it distracts from the now.&quot; -Edna Mode"
"Call me crazy, but why did Tim Cook sound like Riley doing impression on Tim Cook? TIMCEPTION!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=978"">16:18</a> fin."
"The Magic Mouse, lol!! I was waiting for you to ask him about the charging cable, whose fabulous idea was it and why they continue with that stupid model.  Your look was, priceless."
"I think something like “sorry for your lose” to Tim, would be fine"
"I think I did good with my blind ranking, even though he didn’t really do it…<br>1- iPhone<br>2- iPad<br>3- MacBook Air<br>4- Vision Pro<br>5- Magic Mouse<br><br>Has he ever been asked about the Magic Mouse charging design, if not you should have brought up how ridiculously bad it is"
Pretty soon every electronic will have a.i system which can dignoise tech issues within itself &amp; coding will be obsolete. Those who do know coding will be 1% 😂😂🤣 jk
This was a tense interview. This really feel uncomfortable to be at Marques seat .
It’s a curious feature 🤔
"this was funny, Tim does not know what the magic mouse is"
Forgot to ask him about the dirty tactic of not releasing AI to 14 pro users who have neural engine for basically nothing
Tim must have been so nervous during this interview with the GOAT!
The zoom in on Marques&#39;s face while Tim said they got the ergonomics of the magic mouse was priceless lmao
No other tech YouTuber can get to sit down and interview with the ceo of some of the world&#39;s largest tech companies.
"Tim, this is not how the game is played."
Good ol Tim Apple
Did he really say they got tge ergonomics right in magic mouse?
Can someone do a &quot;between two ferns&quot; style edit of this?
Tim saying he likes the vision pro for the multiple windows makes me think he doesn&#39;t realize external monitors work
"Marques yesterday clearly reading his notes on WWDC off an S24 Ultra, today reading off an iPhone. Wonder if he even asked if he could use the Samsung 😅"
Magic Mouse… ergonomics. Never thought I would see those two in the same sentence
I&#39;m sure the track pad had its ergonomics at the core of its design too.
Can we make this comment stay in 69 likes?
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
"Wow, I’m glad you got the interview, but he is clearly a professional politician. He didn’t say a single interesting or useful thing. And completely dodged all the direct questions."
MKBHD: naming their products <br>Tim to everything: it changed the word
“Ergonomics” = “Magic Mouse” ???… apple prolly has its own definition for ergonomics
"ehm, you mean tim apple?!"
Sound like forest cook .
"Thanks, Marques. Finally someone to remember Tim that the Magic Mouse exists. Soon we will see a new one."
This was amazing! So many gems per usual!
i don’t think he understood the game
How to NOT get invited to the next  event 101:
Really cheeky of Marques to even put the Magic Mouse on the list! Love it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> some hesitation there. My guess is Marques is using iPhone 16 and Tim knows it and it will have M1. Although Marques didn’t bring it, Tim kinda wanted to re-confirm."
Ergonomic Magic Mouse lololuolololololololol
"Someone can explain to me why the activity rings on his Apple Watch Ultra are all closed and the stand one says 11 (h), while his time says <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=211"">3:31</a>?"
"marques let out a chuckle but was trying to hold in his laughter when he said magic mouse, i also like how the camera is focused on both their faces during the magic mouse segment lmao!"
MKBHD: Magic Mouse<br>Tim Cook: *sweat intensely
"Please, don&#39;t let him Cook."
My man Tim was lost on this one lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> The edit says it all 😂"
"Tim, If someone ever brings up magic mouse, think trackpad gestures but on a mouse, courage, never been done before, fluid, natural, familiar... just please don&#39;t mention ergonomics"
Did he just say OS 2?
Kudos on the interview!
"The fact that we didn&#39;t get a blind ranking annoys me.  Also, I love how he said the magic mouse is revolutionary because they had to get the ergonomics just right.  That mouse stinks to use for longer than a minute.  He also did a ton of hesitating on the vision pro.  A lot of fortune 500 companies are looking at it for projects.  Yeah, until they see the price tag."
"if will smith could control YouTube rewind ⏪, he’d choose … Fort-Nite … and Mark Ass Brownlee.   Yaaah"
You had Tim Cook for an interview and you didnt ask about the green and blue bubbles?!?
Samsung is till the best no match
Marques went from making videos in his room as a kid to interviewing the CEO of a fortune 100 company. Absolutely amazing!
"Lots of words, nothing of value said, typical."
"Next time do some questions about repairability, please."
"u sneaky sneaky person, that magic mouse moment was absolute soul crusher for tim cook, he will have nightmares of it from now on xD"
"Great to have Apples CEO on the channel. He seems very scare of making a mistake, if you analyze what he says, he doesn’t say anything really."
Find someone who looks at you like MKBHD is looking at Tim Cook in the Thumbnail.
tim says umm and ahh way too many times haha can&#39;t trust those who do that
Tim don&#39;t let him Cook
So complementary 🤦‍♂️
Marques is goated for the Magic Mouse 🤣
"I can&#39;t just imagine, why are you and ur group, inviting CEOs, important guest to talk about Ai..."
The magic mouse was so memorable that he couldn&#39;t say anything about it
Magic Mouse is definitely last on his list lol
Great to c Tim invited here 👌
Why doesn&#39;t the display on Tim&#39;s watch turn off?
what about QUESTIONS about RIGHT TO REPAIR? schematics etc??
Good old Tim Apple
So he didn’t rank them?
you should&#39;ve asked tim why they charging 200$+ for ram upgrades on their entire mac lineup and why ipad os 18 didn&#39;t include support for dual booting into a mac like os
useless questions and interview<br>what about What do you think about Elon musk saying he will ban iphone from tesla ?<br>that will be an interesting question
Witness Tim being a true CEO and his ability<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>to say anything and everything but the answer
"Anyone who actually believes apple cares about privacy must be delusional!.. The only cloud I use is my own!.. really wish the rest of the world thought like this, it is sad to think that someday phones may be nothing more than thin clients."
The way mkbhd was trying so hard to not laugh when he was talking about how good the magic mouses ergonomics were 😭
So wish that Apple would come up with graphics software that is a legitimate Adobe competitor. Especially with Adobe&#39;s recent moves.
The FACE of Marques when Tim said they got the ergonomics WELL on the Magic Mouse was EPIC!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Tim❤
I though an s24 ultra gonna show up in your hands. That would be funny.
Tim: no blind ranking...<br><br>Narrator: Marques will remember this...
Always good to hear from Tim Apple.
I love how he said AI in front of apple to probably annoy them because it&#39;s a forbidden word to them. 😂
was he scared to do the blind ranking?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> Tim looking if Marques made the same mistake as last interview where he brought a galaxy phone 😂"
"What I&#39;d really like to know is whether Marques was either a little naive or really daring to seriously think that Tim would rank Apple products. I immediately thought: no way he&#39;s doing that 😄<br>Did you also notice, that Tim sais that he always likes to look forward, but then takes time to talk about reminiscing about his dead parents? OK, maybe that&#39;s a bit far stretched, but interesting nonetheless"
"“Extablished”?!?!  For the love of God… And Steve Jobs, please bring on the next CEO of Apple! 🤦🏻"
The slow zoom in waiting for &quot;ergonomics&quot; about the magic mouse lol
I was waiting for the answer why the A16 can’t handle chat gpt a.k.a Apple intelligence
"When Tim mentioned that their objective isn&#39;t to be the first but the best, everything about Apple suddenly made sense to me.😊"
Tim was nervous
"Marques is scared to confront Time about the Magic Mouse, he doesn&#39;t want to lose the connection hahaha"
Apple watch is one of most disruptive to focus watches. There are more discreet ones
laptop presentoion: incredible<br>Ipad: incredible<br>Magic mouse: INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
Jesus Christ Tim is good at the apple steps of service &lt;3
That magic mouse moment 😂😂
Marques you&#39;re amongst the best! Such an excellent bridge between the mainstream and us tech nerds.
I&#39;ll never foerget Marques&#39; face when looking at Tim responding to the Magic Mouse. Some words won&#39;t be said about that 😅
This dude looks intense! Well done for conducting such a great interview ❤
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a><br>ERGONOMICS WELL DONE! <b>AGGRESSIVE ZOOMING</b> 😂😂😂"
Wish something more happened in this interview
Not asking about iPadOS deficiencies?
Great interview from both sides. The Magic Mouse bit was a touch awkward - both sides know it wasn’t apples finest moment yet both refused to acknowledge it.
"Solid last spot for the mouse 😂 <br><br>“Marques face, (The ergonomics for the mouse)” <br><br>😂"
"That last section was absolutely phenomenal. Exposing Tim as someone who really just bullshits on the fly, great job"
"For those who wanted proof MKBHD is biased towards apple, he uploaded it himself. There is a reason why LTT would never be able to have an interview like this, and it has nothing to do with money or reach or influence because LTT has more of all three than MKBHD does."
“I use the Vision Pro for the entertainment value”!!whats entertainment value are you getting from $3500 gadget?
I love the insight from Tim. Great interview.
"lol <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a>  he couldn’t differentiate whether this was a 15 pro or not. Good job Tim"
Indirectly Lgbtq promoting
MKBHD trolling Tim Cook IRL with the Magic Mouse ranking
Buy your mom an AI
Am I going crazy or is Tim saying “ecstablish” everything he is meaning to say “establish”
Why does Tim Cook have good teeth on top and bad teeth on the bottom?
did tim actually answer any of the questions
insightful
Nice advert.
I demand that Marques releases the &quot;Ai&quot; cut of this video!
It&#39;s funny that you made a comment that his answer was very &quot;Lebron&quot;<br><br>I couldn&#39;t disagree more.  Tim cook says &quot;my legacy is defined when others look at me.  So I don&#39;t focus on that&quot;<br><br>Lebron says &quot;I&#39;m the greatest player of all time&quot; on a Tv show that he produces. LOL
"The year is 3045, you&#39;re watching this video on your holographic  wristband that isn&#39;t smart and only works by connecting it directly to your forcefully installed custom ROMed Neuralink chip while laughing quietly in the 5th basement  of a building being actively searched for any sign of life by combat droids....."
"You tried Marques… lol he wasn’t giving you much. Magic Mouse: Watershed product?! I don’t hate it like you do, but come on Tim."
Microsoft’s AI be like “I’m going to be a security concern”
Well he lost my attention when he said machine learning is ai….. it’s not.
Steve would&#39;ve actually ranked the products...
I enjoyed the part where even Tim Cook couldn&#39;t tell you what the fuck Vision Pro is useful for....
"Questions was asked, answers was not given.😂😂😂"
I wonder if ceos talk slowly on purpose to waste a little time to save their asses to a potential question that might make them look bad...
I would have asked him why my iPhone 15 is not getting apple intelligence
"I like how Marques was able to listen to Tim Cook&#39;s responses while also not taking any marketing crap.<br>Also, the editing was humorously prudent during certain sections of the video :)"
Marques and his old friend Tim Apple.
"Damn this dude has gone a long way from his earlier videos, congrats 🍾🎈"
Tim gave 0 rankings
any system requires a database that a CEO can gain access to?
Tim collaborating with MKBHD to get more Subscribers to Apple
Tim: getting the ergonomics…<br>Margues: The Magic Mouse
Seems like Marq was testing Tim
Tim Cook talking so much without saying anything. Not really answered questions.
"mhh, nope. i dont like the dude - he is boring, talking a lot of apple-bla and that not in a convincing way. whatever tho :)"
Does anyone know the name of the Nike shoes Tim is wearing in this video?
Bro has been media trained
the magic mouse ahhhhh ah
Logic Clone Wars III for the intro 🔥
"Nice interview, too bad Tim didn’t actually ranked"
"I would like to know who is representing the company &quot;Apple&quot; in this interview. MKBHD should actually be the one leading Apple. Poor Tim imho..<br>Sometimes it seems like a dismissal interview between employee and boss. MKBHD is the boss, of course"
Why does Tim&#39;s accent sound like spoiled rich girl accent
Tim waving that arm around not so subtly flexing that he closed his rings like HOURS ago lmao
"He didn&#39;t rank his own products because, as the CEO, it could&#39;ve probably affected their sales performance 😂"
No mention of Right to Repair
"Can’t stand TC. Inauthentic, unoriginal, gaslighter, self serving, hypocritical. Otherwise he is a wonderful guy."
I bet Tim hasn&#39;t used the Magic Mouse before. 😂
Man the “magic Mouse” was hilarious 😂🎉 hahahah
"In 2016, Cook signed a $275 billion deal with Chinese officials.[52] The deal – personally negotiated by Cook – paved the way for increased censorship by Apple in China, for example the removal of Muslim content, preventing users from entering numbers that refer to the date of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, censoring Chinese words like &quot;human rights&quot; or &quot;democracy&quot;, and manipulating Apple Maps to support China in the Senkaku Islands dispute by making Chinese-claimed islands appear larger than they actually were.[53][54][55] In August 2021, Cook received an approximate $750 million payout, selling more than five million shares in Apple, ten years after becoming CEO.[56][57]"
Huge!
Bro got Tim Apple 😮
"I didn’t feel Tim was being completely sincere, I felt he needed to drop completely rehearsed answers. We didn’t not see Tim as a person, we saw Tim CEO from Apple. I wish he had been a little bit less tense"
MKBHD ditched S24 for iPhone 15 Pro Max ?
Mr. Cook trying to cook up something positive about the Magic Mouse is hilarious.
Tim literally made sum bullshit up lmfao Number 1 Scam Artists
He made apple say AI 😂😂😂 normally
Cheeky cheeky Marques!! 🤣 Wish you had pointed out the ergonomics being not so good in everybody&#39;s opinion...
&#39;Screen Time&#39; is the first feature to be turned off by those truly addicted to their phones.
Apple is scared MKBHD might kill Apple Intelligence so called him to have an interview
Bro forgot what the magic mouse was😂
How does Tim claim to not look back in the past when the current iPhone has square edges like the iPhone 5? 😅
I don’t know this video is relevant to the recent pump for Apple Inc. Stocks 😅
I am so happy for your success. What a legendary YouTube career.
man i love apple but the magic mouse literally gave me carpel tunnel what are u talkin about tim 😭
Coloring is way off
"that zoom in to MKBHD&#39;s face when Tim put ergonomics, perfect and magic mouse in the same sentence was priceless 😂"
"Say what you will, they are a company that makes money off of products. Android? They make their money from your information. Like, it&#39;s not even close in terms of revenue streams. If that&#39;s not a conflict of interest, I don&#39;t know what is."
It was refreshing to hear Tim actually answer questions instead of revisit talking points.
even if the AI is done on device... its still going tor report everything back to the company... don&#39;t be fooled.
Tim thinking of ways to design and release an iMarques 😂
This was a very insightful interview. I wish there was a question about sources Apple uses for training image generating for Apple Intelligence. I’m sure there are many concerned people in the photo and illustration communities.
Tim Cook has never used magic mouse lol
Have large corporations taken over popular YouTube tech reviewers and influenced their perceptions?<br><br>These generic questions are very unusual from an experienced tech reviewer.
Marques had to help Tim with his AI verbiage lmao... like he supported Tim like AI..
My blind ranking:<br>MacBook Air: 3<br>iPad: 2<br>Magic Mouse: 5 (would put it lower if allowed)<br>iPhone: 1 (that&#39;s why I left room above iPad)<br>Vision Pro: 4<br><br>Nailed it. That&#39;s the list I would have made if I knew the contestants before starting.
So cool to see MKBHD taking time out of his day to talk to his fans.
Ask this dude why the iPad OS sucks
"Great interview…look, listen and learn:)!"
“The Magic Mouse?…” 😂😂😂
From review tech in his bedroom to interviewing the CEO of one of the most valuable companies in the world. 🤯
Missed opportunity to use a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for the interview.
"Ahhh, you bottled it! You swapped out the Samsung for this conversation 😅<br><br>Fair, I&#39;d probably have done the same!"
When is somebody gonna ask where the is split screen
What Nikes is Tim wearing?
"CEO of a giant company, and got all his activity Rings closed mid-day!"
THE AWKWARD SILENCE WHEN HE SAID MAGIC MOUSE SOS
THE REAL INTERVIEW WE WAITED FOR...
"Apple rules for the interview: “Whatever you do, don’t mention iPad OS or interview over.” Lol. (Dankpods covered it. Lol 😂) “We want to be the best.” Uhhhh. You are but it’s not good. <br><br>App Store “became an economic miracle” for Apple. 30% of your work goes straight to us! lol. <br><br>Glad M got the opportunity to sit with him but nothing much — as expected — in terms of meat on the bone."
"Congrats Tim, with this interview, you might have peacked"
"Hopefully one day y&#39;all will finally understand that Marques is not different from CNN,He&#39;s a Liberal puppet used by the system to push an agenda. If he had an independent thought they&#39;ll not be giving him special access"
MKBHD is nervous lol why? You know more on apple than Tim 😅
Magic Mouse 🤣
Tim Cook seems very sincere. He must really love his Magic Mouse! 😉<br><br>Great interview from Marques B as usual.
"vague questions.. nothing about why the AI only for 15 Pro, why all these new 5 year old features appearing now etc... I mean this kid just want fame and prob gets some cash from apple"
Who is that old guy ?
That&#39;s how you answer questions without answering them.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> was a little cringe lmaooooo I really hope Tim didn&#39;t think MKBHD was an iOS user 😂😂😂😂"
Tim became a real life spinning beach ball when the Magic Mouse was mentioned
Congrats Marques! <br>You represent us the buyers 😊
this actually happen?
iphone 14 pro should have gotton Ai Because it has the original iphone 15 chip. What a let down.
5 minutes in and everything he said was literally meaningless and void. Zero. And this is supposed to be an intelligent man? Everything was generic as hell.
They are both walking on eggshells because of the shit they&#39;ll get into for saying the wrong thing
"AI, Appleficial Intelligence"
We need Soldier Knows Best In here! You both are my Tech idols. Jon too!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> Man DEADASS said &quot;getting the ergonomics&quot;, who the hell did they use to test it? captain arthritis? it&#39;s the N1 in the world worst mice period no questions asked, the worst invention to ever come out of Apple HQ, the damn spastic mouse"
Let Tim cook!
He&#39;s so political and doesn&#39;t give any strong opinions which makes him uninteresting
I actually like the Magic Mouse quite a bit.
Galaxy Ai /Gemini :  useless 💩<br><br>Apple Intelligence : 👌🏽🤯🤌🏽😍<br><br>No Gemini on Pixel 8 : 🤬😤<br><br>Apple Intelligence only for 15 Pro and above :  👍🏽😊😴<br><br>Microsoft Windows recall : 😒🙄🤬☠️<br><br>Apple Personal context :🤩🥰🫦🍆👅<br><br>People are really hypocrites and 🤡<br><br><br>🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️
So was Magic Mouse number one? 😂
So No official ranking on those devices 😂
"Honestly this was probably the closest to a “Non Apple Shill” I’ve seen from Tim Cook. Not just trying to sell the product but actually talking about them. As for the rankings, I do think he was a little confused by it more than anything. After the first one I woulda asked where he would rank it rather then jumping to the next one. <br><br>Very interesting and rare to see an interview like this. Great video man!"
Blud did not understand the game😂
Tim Apple isn&#39;t great at games..
Marques was trying so hard to not laugh when Tim was talking about the magic mouse
Tim is like magic what now?
People with level 99 media training are so hard to listen too.
prime interview of a sociopath.
How do you not bring up iPadOS??
Do someone else pay attention to Tim Cook  confusing?
"Witnessing MKBHD going iconic. Proud of you Marques, walking in the corridors of power."
marques : the magic mouse ? ok :)
Tim did not quite grasp the concept of a blind ranking haha
"Marques, your intelligence and character shine through your body language and insightful questions. On the other hand, I was unimpressed with Tim Cook. His manner of speaking and body language lacked inspiration. The only times I found myself smiling during Tim&#39;s speech, and he seemed to avoid addressing core topics, were when footage of Steve Jobs popped up. No wonder this channel has gathered as many subscribers as Apple on YouTube, and Apple is in a slow but steady decline. Too massive corporate conservative, too comfortable, too focused on holding a monopoly while hindering innovation."
Magic Mouse 😂😂😂😂
The editing around Tim talking about the Magic Mouse has me balling
"circle is an object in circular space,<br> but it&#39;s not a square"
Tim will talk about this moment to future generations
Tim Cook&#39;s long thinking about the answers is kinda annoying to me. I know he has to match every answer to Apple&#39;s standards but every answer felt like a whole keynote.
It is just me or Tim is afraid of MKBHd 😂. Don’t bankrupt apple.
"Marques, you&#39;re a badass, man. I mean when you did that Kobe interview, I thought that was peak. Glad to see you keep reaching higher peaks"
"“Our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be best” <br><br>Android users hate these words while never comprehending those same words."
Funny that not even Tim was able to tell if it was a 15 or an older one 😂
he was trying to say &quot;we dont care what happens as long as we are not missing more pieces of the pie&quot;
Much Love but Videos like this are why i cant take MKBHD seriously as a tech reviewer anymore
He needs to stop talking like siri
MKBHD legend status for Apple mouse soundbite &amp; reaction.
I would find it very interesting what Marcus thought about the answers
"Whenever he opens his mouth, some kind shit must come out !!!!🥹"
Tim saying that the magic mouse was an incredible moment and then realizing he messed up when he said that was hilarious
"He cant even say Arm archeture of chips, cook constant BS at best , some of us dont want AI or need it. The device belongs to the customer not Apple, so does the control of the device, Apple cant be trusted &amp; sad to say theyre even worse than microsoft &amp; google !"
Lmaooooo the little smirk he did when Tim talked about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 😂😂😂😂
You said AI like 10 times in the first question just to spite apple didnt you xD
bro on a attack mode on tim
"Tim his excellence and way of speaking is so relaxing to listen to, i can listen to this man for days on end<br>The way he is rocketing Apple in the right direction is amazing to see, im so happy to be a Apple user!"
"He just refused to play blind ranking, and Marques didn’t challenge him on it at all lol"
that was tense
"kid who reviewed tiny tech, now sits with Tim Apple"
Magic mouse is Hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Like listening to a politician get interviewed, but I suppose any CEO is like that (more or less)."
"I think the game of ranking is a bad idea, it putted him in a very uncomfortable situation, because he is ceo he&#39;s in a place where he defend his company wherever."
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=876"">14:36</a> “I use it for…uh…entertainment…uh… value and review enterprise apps”. <br><br>The problem with Tim Cook is that he is never seems genuine and candid about his personal opinions or his feelings about Apple products. He always seems to have a filter - what words can I use to say to sounds sales-y. Hence the Magic Mouse ergonomics. COME ON!<br>Jobs never spoke about Apple TV like it was the best. He explicitly said it was a hobby at that time. Just like Vision Pro is now."
This was a great interview. I wish it had have been longer. Great use of the time though.
"Marques, I just have to say I really enjoy your channel and you seem like a really down-to-earth human being even with your popularity and fame you seem grounded and rooted who you are and this interview with Tim was interesting. Maybe not groundbreaking but it also just felt down earth no politics no BS just fun conversations with a CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world. Godspeed with the growth of your various channels."
👏👏👏 Can&#39;t get better than this!
"We have a 19 million subscribers, Tim was certainly going to make time as he knows how important Marquez is his community"
"Now that the AI is fully Siri now (modern AI, not original AI) I don&#39;t wanna get any phone newer than the iPhone X, I don&#39;t like how it&#39;s not able to be removed"
Can anybody fill me in on Tim&#39;s glasses here? I like the style.
Powerful people saying they don’t look to the past is wild and scary
"İ imagine, poor apple engineers are forced to use magic mouse at the office. just for that reason, they would be prefering working at home to use their own mouse"
“We don’t have museums” of past products. We recycle them for free with a trade.
when he said ergonomics marques thinking what ergonomics 💀
The fact that Tim knows Marques daily&#39;s an S24 and had to confirm he had an iPhone with him.
This message for Tim <br>Please stop promote LGBTQ 😑
Politicians could learn a thing or two about not answering the question at all from Tim here.
😂😂😂😂 ergonomic and apple mouse
Hahahha “Lebron” answer. No way Tim Cook knows what that means 😂
Tim Apple&#39;s Official Blind Ranking:<br>5. iPhone<br>4. iPad<br>3. Mac Air<br>2. Vision Pro<br>1. Magic Mouse
Tim really is all about security and privacy. They made sure that deleted photos weren’t actually deleted cuz they didn’t want the trash bin to steal my data and so they could hold it themselves. So noble <br>/j
He said AI!
Tim Apple finally found his Internet legitimacy and save Apples bankruptcy from the wrath of MKB
Tims cadence is so fascinating to me. Corporate but personable and totally laid back. So cool!
Tim Cook wanted badly to show people that Marquees is using Apple products.
Where is can’t explain what I think about that fantastic great terrific and everything else that I can’t get out my mouth thank you😊
🐐
"“We never look to be the first, just the best”"
Backwards compatibility is just not a part of our culture
What time was this interview filmed that Tim had already closed all his rings?
Thank you Tim Apple
I would like to hear what he has to say about putting a 60hz screen on iPhone 15 which costs 800€ in base model.
Marques is not just a good YouTuber; also a killer interviewer.
"No museums at Apple, huh? Only looking forward? The phone icon is modeled after 80&#39;s corded phones. The save icon is a floppy disk. Their entire OS is a museum to old tech."
He’s definitely not going to answer any of your interview invites ever again.
"It&#39;s all about what benefits the user, like app store lock in and standing in the way of device repair.  Saying &quot;Tim Apple&quot; may have been a gaff, but it&#39;s apt, he&#39;s not his own man. Everything he does and says in public is company marketing."
"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people&#39;s throats. It&#39;s your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.<br><br>So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God&#39;s standard). You, I and most( most because babies don&#39;t sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God&#39;s moral law. Since God is just, He can&#39;t let sin go just like that.<br><br>So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. <br><br>The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus&#39;s, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus&#39;s spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 ."
"Well, Tim we’re ready for a new Apple CEO, now because of your price gouging and redundant “so-called” device upgrades of “this machine is even more powerful than the previous…” How about allow iPads to run macOS, make front cameras 2k or higher, add more ports to iPads to attach hardware easier like hard drives, headphones, midi keyboards, etc. Significantly reduce prices of all Apple devices and accessories like your adapters, Magic Keyboard and other Apple peripherals. Add better bass response to your iPad Pro and improve its overall sound, which would mean adding thickness back for improved bass resonance. Perhaps, make 2 different thickness sizes for users to choose. Listen to customer suggestions and requests. Improve innovation because many of the new &amp; upcoming features are features that other brands already created."
Well damn!
"God, I can’t wait for Craig to replace this guy lol."
"Access journalist, corporate shill at play."
Tim should resign. He&#39;s old and can&#39;t innovate anymore.
The ranking is ridiculously meaningless.  Naive.
MKB is a great interviewer. Great stuff!
what&#39;s media training? <br>Tim: Hold my magic mouse!
Good ol Tim Crook.
Let Tim Cook 😮‍💨
Tim almost forgot what the Magic Mouse was for a second because he probably doesn&#39;t even use it 🤣
the amount of bulshit for second this guy says
Tim Apple wow
This is what MLK was dreaming of. Period.
"Looking at Tim&#39;s watch, it&#39;s 3:30pm and he has 11 stand goal hours!!"
"It’s sad, and almost hard to see Tim so nervous, doubtful and confused. Swuallowing saliva after some questions. It’s so clear apple lived the past 10 years over the fundations steve made. And now it’s a new era and apple has not a clear vision about it"
"Wow, Tim Apple how great!"
Tim thought he cooked
I see you you got those connections
interview final boss
His face when he was glazing the Magic Mouse 😂
He definitely struggled to find something good about the Magic Mouse and just came up with the most unrealistic argument for it “Ergonomics” better would just if he said: “The way we placed the lightning port was groundbreaking”
first question and he already gaslit so hard. damn CEOs
Tim: “Best day ever”
Dang asking Tim Cook to do a blind ranking is dangerous
waiting for interview with Sam Altman
Tim Apple!!
Apple executives definately sent Marques a list of things like “Do not look Tim in the eye for too long”<br>“Do not interrupt his excellence” <br>“Kiss his shoes upon his arrival”
The magic mouse omg 😂😂😂you almost laughed uncontrollably 😂😂😂😂I just felt it 😂😂😂
Nice interview but would be a bit better to run the audio through some voice isolation processing or eq to get the humm and noise out. There seems to a phase issue as well.
He saw reaction of people and rushed to Marques to say excuses after seeing Apple stock crashing
"sorry, but this was the most &quot;ceo talk&quot; you could ever get..not ranking anything - well ok. but praising for example the ergonomics of the magic mouse or not in the slightest talking about anything, which could be better off  in the future with at least some improvements.. makes me sad<br>my grandpa could have done the same interview (from cook&#39;s side respectively) and said nothing much different.<br>thanks for trying though, marques"
"Tim never got that cooked. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=739"">12:19</a>"
This was just downward rude asking him about the Magic Mouse😂😳
Now mkbhd is bigger than apple(sub) this was going to happen
I was hoping to see Marques Holding his S24 Ultra in this interview 😂
mk you were trying so hard not to laugh about the mouse question lmao
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> of ALL things Tim Cook could mention. Ergonomics. He&#39;s not that good on the spot to be honest, I could&#39;ve thought of something better: Gestures, seamlessness or just even acknowledge that they just wanted a &quot;cool looking mouse&quot;. Anything would have been better than saying &quot;ergonomics&quot;."
Not a single direct answer .
"Apple Intelligence !! Really?! Who comes up with these in Apple? To be honest Apple has run out of steam now, and Tim was never an innovative guy, he comes from efficient operations. Apple is suffering from Tim’s limited vision and experience. It’s about time Apple gets a new CEO who can bring back Apple’s innovative DNA"
Such a shame he couldn&#39;t be a good sport and just play the game... it was out of fun. Not a &quot;gotcha&quot; moment.
"I hate that every Apple employee refuses to name or rank their favourite Apple product. Like it’ll get them fired or cause the world to explode. It’s just a bit of fun, it’s not that deep fam."
Tim ❤❤❤❤❤
Marques asking some really important questions.👏🏾👏🏾
😂 Tim was doubting if you had an iPhone 15 lol! Great Video! Thanks! 🙏
&quot;Our objective is never to be first; our objective is to be BEST!&quot;<br><br>YASSS! 🥹🔥
Hey it&#39;s Tim Apple!
"lol. Cook’s brain is 40 steps in front of you., and you never realise it Marques. Lol"
Tim Cook totally doesn’t no what Magic Mouse is and neither do i
What are those watch complications cook’s using?
"It&#39;s cool to see Tim Apple taking time to have a conversation with all these tech Youtubers, first its SuperSaf, then iJustine, and now Marques..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a><br>Pay closer attention to where Tim&#39;s eyes 👀 are looking when he answers. Ask any criminal justice major, they can tell you what part of the brain he was reaching.<br><br>It&#39;s kinda interesting to see MKBHD&#39;s reaction as well. His face was precious imo. Gotta love him for controlling his own response (in a way). He probably just wants to be invited back after that interview"
Bruh this woman really said ranking products is like asking your favorite kid or nephew 😅
Mkbhd is a horrible interviewer 😂
He didn&#39;t know what to say about the &quot;magic mouse&quot;. 😂<br>More of a &quot;trash mouse&quot;
Crazy how Tim talks about crash detection on the watch when I literally got hit by a car and mine never went off 🤡
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=923"">15:23</a> effortlessly slipped that one in"
The Magic Mouse moment 😂. Tim was also struggling to say something positive about it 😂. Like ughhh can’t diss it.
"If i was tim, i was would ask marques what he thinks instead"
When will Apple bring out a YTube competitor with a BitTorrent backbone. We are sick of using this platform. We  can’t even search transcripts.
Great interview. Well done!
So well shot!
I love how you had to clarify after he said ergonomics were in important when it came to Magic Mouse 😂 I saw that smirk!
"Magic mouse, the mouse ergonomic mouse ever 😂"
crapple
Tim is no Steve Jobs!
Magic Mouse - the ergonomics? That question really rubbed it in the face 🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=771"">12:51</a> br I can&#39;t this is too good lmao"
&quot;We believe that it&#39;s private&quot; 😂
I think Tim should seriously consider a career as a diplomat after he retires.
Dub dub is a thing now?
What happened with your S24 in this interview? 😅
"Great interview.  What shoes are you wearing, they look awesome?"
Magic Mouse was a good one to ask Tim .. lol
Spicy 🌶️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=660"">11:00</a> &quot;ecstablish&quot; why do the Americans/people overall maybe (?) do it? :’) &quot;ecspecially&quot; too, just WHY (from a non-native speaker, and yeah, I kinda know they are overcorrecting, but it still hurts 🥴"
"You should had asked, what are the apps in your iPhone?"
"Big pause on the magic mouse question lol. At the time it came out I thought it was pretty cool, in fairness. Them removable battery connections, though - ugh!"
Tim is doing great. But it’s a shame that the world lost a pioneer Steve Jobs so early…
WTF is he talking about. Apple always (used to) looked to the past for inspiration for the future. No wonder they seem lost.
- What do you use vision pro for? Tim&#39;s body language clearly says that he doesn&#39;t use that thing 😂😂
That whole blind ranking was really about the magic mouse 😂😭 I literally spat when he said getting the ergonomics well done 🤡🤡🤡
I just want someone to hammer him with questions about Crypto. What&#39;s apple planning on. Give us some hints papa Timmy.
Great interview both parties 👏
Is he Mitch McConnell’s brother?
The magic mouse bit😭😭 perfection
awkward intro<br>dont do it like that again
Tim Cook says &quot;ex-stablished&quot; lol
This is awesome MKBHD 🎉
Steve was CEO in the modern era of Apple for 12 years<br><br>Tim is at 14 and counting <br><br>Time keeps moving on.
"Bro had to confirm if he was still talking about magic mouse 😂😂😭 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a>"
MKBHD should have taken a Samsung phone and put it on the table
"He didn&#39;t talk about how the Magic Mouse has the charging port below it so you can&#39;t use it while charging, or why it took so long for Apple to swap the lightning port to USB-C? What a missed opportunity."
"You was pressing Tim hard bro not even gonna lie, super entertaining 🤣"
Not the Magic Mouse 😂
not a single critical or difficult question that consumers have been wondering about apple. nice work
You&#39;re getting too soft.
Good ol’ Tim Apple
I see MKBHD is letting Tim Cook...
Looks like Tim wearing an Apple Watch.  Why not a Vision Pro?
Cut to Marques when Tim mentions &quot;getting the magic mouse ergonomics right&quot; 👀
You know youtube compression is bad when MKBHD&#39;s video background wall has noise and artifacts
"Is it just me or does Tim Cook just say the same thing over and over, rephrasing it, making it seem like he said something new? It feels like pushing an AI model to answer something it genuinely does not know the answer to, except he does know the answers. I didn&#39;t feel like I got much out of this &quot;Interview&quot;, and Cook very much sounds like a robot."
The current CEO OF Apple in an interview with the future CEO of Apple. Congratulations MKBHD you just solidified your position as the new Apple CEO.
Where is question about why they turn iOS into Android? Thats so sad
The only apple product I regret buying is Magic Mouse. ☹
Doesn&#39;t know how to rank things......lets play a game.......lets not :/
Marques back with the big interviews
Why do we need Private Cloud Compute ? iPhone is not powerful enough to perform those planned computations ? Or do you need more space ? Or PCC will do the computation on a community or may be something like batch level ?
im out
"daddy, what does &quot;cringe&quot; mean? well, just look at Markes face when Tim talks about the ergonomics of the magic mouse. 🤣"
Props to MKBHD for getting a 16 Min segment. Most other reviewers got like 10 mins!
&quot;LeBron answer&quot; LOL
The least interesting CEO in the history of CEOs.
Really huge of MKBHD to give these lesser known individuals a platform
Marques such a humble guy
"i think one the glaring things i notice about tim cook&#39;s response is that he is always trying to sell you the product. in the last segment when you asked him to do a ranking, he couldn&#39;t help but default to explain the product details. of course if you are buying an apple product you know exactly why you are buying the apple product, but he doesn&#39;t talk about it with the same passion and creative spark that steve did"
This young Tim Apple guy is going places if you ask me
Very nice AD who ever make this script very good
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> for the Magic Mouse 👀"
hey
Imagine cheating at blind ranking
Phew that was so boring to watch
"Let him cook <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/E8MfY5u7JPSXkNAP95GAmAE""></a>"
Looks like the start of a Hollywood blockbuster
"&quot;Privacy is a key tenant...&quot;  So tell me about that thing where you can wipe a phone that didn&#39;t have anything sync&#39;d to iCloud, and it just randomly comes back after a recent iOS update?<br><br>I dunno man.  TC is a brilliant logistics guy, but I just have a hard time believing any of his &quot;gee golly, I can&#39;t wait to see what you do with it&quot; nonsense.  Maybe he&#39;s actually a real straight shooter, but I can&#39;t help feel like everything out of this guy&#39;s mouth is a sanitized half-truth.  I dunno what it is.  It just hits as entirely unauthentic BS.  I don&#39;t buy any of it."
So... the ergonomics of the magic mouse was on purpose...
"I see that MacBook Air, I hear Fiona Apple."
"Next apple ceo, talking to the current apple ceo."
"Marques, you’re so natural in those interviews. Keep them coming. It was a really good talk."
The potential of the game was so great..but tim had to be political about it
I feel like Timmy struggled a bit especially with the Magic Mouse question. Also. Wtf does his iPad do that mine didn’t ? I can’t fine a reason for one.
The fact that Tim didn’t know which iPhone he had says it all. 😂😂
I respect the work it takes to get from reviewing tech on youtube to interviewing the CEOs of some of the largest tech companies in the world.
"Ultra-short version: Privacy, AI, blah-blah"
"in this entire video with tim cook talking apple made 200,000,000 dollars"
"Compared to a lot of CEOs, Tim seems like a really cool guy."
Ask him why is it the same iPhone each year with minimal changes
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=974"">16:14</a> Whoever at MKBHD came up with the Blind Ranking question is getting fired in the morning 😅"
"When he aid we won&#39;t wait for privacy legislation, i wish Marq had asked him why they waited for usbc legislation."
Magic Mouse? Do we eve have that? - Tim
Apple intelligence must be the cringiest thing I&#39;ve heard in a long time
And yet Apple is not able to give us layers when editing photos and it&#39;s impossible to put text infront of pen drawings.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> that face when you know a mf lying but you listening anyway 😂"
Not the Magic Mouse lol
Tim disgusted it&#39;s only an iPhone 15 lol
"He talks like a politician, no straight answers"
Tim’s a smart dude. He knows exactly what people want to hear. Hopefully most of us will remember these promises of privacy. Trust is a huge part of that and the way Apple pitched this AI stuff shows they are fully aware of the consequences of this data were to be breached.
"marques is THE single most influential person in tech HANDS DOWN. he sets trends, he sets standards, and sets the tone on the industry."
"A thoughtful censored, neutered kind of way."
Tim Cook is such a crashing bore! And woke-infested on top….
damage control mode: full
“With the mouse?” I know what you wanted to say there~
"That forced straight face on marques face at Magic Mouse, loooooooolllllll literally said no comment"
Why does Tim Cook sound like a healthier version of old Mitch McConnell?
Tim Cook must be the happiest person to have a talk with MKBHD<br><br>Now if y’all got a chance to question Cook what would it be?
"Love that comment - legacy is how others perceive you, not something you define yourself - MJ vs Lebron"
Give MKBHD an employee badge already
"Love MKBHD, but it seems him heart was not in it. Tim looked like he was ready for a nap"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=772"">12:52</a> tim cooked hard at the bulshit this one 🗣️🗣️"
Such an incredible interview!
“We believe” that we’ve done in such a way that is as safe as secure and private in the private cloud compute as the device.<br><br>Mmm that doesn’t sound too sure man! That is sus
"Marques called Tim&#39;s answer Lebron-like, and only a few minutes later Tim shows how right Marques was, by lying about using the vision pro last night 😂"
I wished next time you are  even more brave and ask things like why Apple Intelligence is not supported by older iPhones or why iPadOS does by far not use the potential of its hardware like macOS would. Or what about the HomePods using Apple Intelligence including finally a hopefully smart Siri. 😐
"Marques, I am surprised that you missed the difference between Private Cloud Computing and Open AI integration. Awesome content, otherwise, keep up the good work, many thanks!<br>And I know what you did there:<br>Cook: Getting the ergonomics well done.<br>Marques: Video zoomed, almost smiling: With Magic mouse, okay. <br>Lol"
You really must challenge them on the creation of e-waste through their silly pricing strategy with ludicrous price bumps for sensible storage options
"&quot;Our objective is never to be first, it&#39;s to be best.&quot;"
Tim Cook is an expert snake oil salesman
I also suspect that Apple’s image generation is mostly limited to cartoony or sketch looks so it can’t be used to make negative photos of public figures and brands and such
The Goat and Tim Cook
Shot on the S24 Ultra
mAGIC MOUSE
this whole interview shows how clueless Tim is about ai
"He doesn&#39;t say the ergonomics on the &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; were correct, he said that was where the focus was. He didn&#39;t fail it or pump it. He pointed to the intended value add but left the outcome judgment to users. Subjectivity is the sign of an unconscious listener."
One thing we under-appreciate is Tim’s humbleness and thoughtfulness. More CEOs could learn from him. Thanks for this interview.
Bro asked about legacy he made it about the company had same vision like him. That&#39;s a professional bullsitter
Did you just compare Tom Cook to LeBron? 😂
"Im glad hes smiling and reaching out, but I still hate apples business model and find it repulsive. That said, microsoft is getting there."
Magic mouse<br>Yeah
They can’t even implement back button🤔
hope vision pro 2 can be release fast because the current battery life is so suck
Really enjoyed this interview Marcus!. Really nice just to see a normal guy talking to Tim. Very valuable interview in my opinion.
Can we have the part where he convinced you that he won&#39;t rate them 🤣
I’d hate to play poker with Marques.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> I love how Marques is trying not to laugh 😂"
"Bro, it would have been awesome if you brought some Redmi or Motorola phone instead of the iphone :D"
"There&#39;s no way he&#39;s actually happy with the rate that developers are making apps for vision pro lol<br><br>If it seriously exceeded their expectations, then that&#39;s great, but I just really don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> bro tryna hide his laugh🤣🤣🤣"
"Tim absolutely refused to play the blind ranking game lol. Would’ve been nice to get an actual ranking from him, but oh well."
"Marques, in November, I will make 11 years since I&#39;ve been your subscriber. It&#39;s really Amazing what you accomplished and how far you have gone through this time man. It&#39;s incredible how you have kept increasing the interest and quality of your videos for your subscribers for such a long time! Congratulations man! <br><br>You reached a level where multinational companies think twice when their current/future device updates get released after your reviews! You definitely deserve the attention and respect that you&#39;re getting in IT."
great interview!
Cook can cook 🧑‍🍳 ?
"The blind ranking game is a genius idea, it’s a shame that Tim didn’t participate"
"When Tim pointed to MKBHD&#39;s Apple watch, It feels awkward"
"Weak, Tim Cook didn&#39;t want to play the ranking game, that was a great idea. Good interview overall, I wish you had asked him about RCS and iMessage but I&#39;m guessing he didn&#39;t want to talk about that.<br><br>Another question I thought would have been good, &quot;with the ability to rearrange icons and giving users more flexibility with how to use the device, if there is sort of a culture shift going on at Apple or what was the motivation behind that change. Why didn&#39;t it come sooner, and what is different now.&quot; Something like that"
"Tim Cook, living embodiment of a golf shirt."
His answers are on par for a CEO😂😂 It’s almost like they are trained to talk in the most generic and politically correct manner possible 🙆🏾‍♂️😂😭
"Poor MB had to pretend he was satisfied with TC&#39;s answers 😅 he&#39;s preception if not looking back proves they ignore their customer needs like a tyrant😔 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=592"">9:52</a> I say it&#39;s time!!!"
Great Video.<br><br>My next Apple CEO suggestion is Linus Sebastian. 😮😊 Yup!<br>He has the chops and the media experience.<br>And has the business funny.😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=333"">5:33</a> tim literally got confused which iPhone model is that 😂"
BRO HOLDING HIS LOUGH ON MAGIC MOUSE
i think Apple view MKBHD as a necessary evil..better let him have a controlled interview so they can &quot; control&quot; whats beeing said..<br>it speaks to the amount of credibility Marques has earned in this space..love the content - hate the company(;
You can tell Marques was holding his facial expressions in some BS Tim was saying...
"Well done Marques! You have a way of asking questions I would ask but in a way that feels conversational, and the vibe you create is so positive."
Was shocked when MKBHD brought about keeping things on the phone after the old deleted photo resurrection incident
The way Tim said “The Magic Mouse” sounded like he was about to narrate a children’s picture book lol
"My opinion: Marquet was simply super prepared, but Tim Cook was somehow erratic and sometimes didn&#39;t answer the questions and resorted to pre-cut statements that he already had in his head."
It’s really telling how even Tim Cook couldn’t come up with a good selling point for the Vision Pro on the spot. Reviewing enterprise apps and looking at photos doesn’t sell a $3500 device. There’s no killer app.
I just want AirPower
"I&#39;ve been using the magic mouse for 15 years as a designer, it&#39;s by far my favorite mouse for the mac. Never understood the hate."
From reviewing Apple products in a basement to interviewing the Apple CEO!
That was a good interview but definitely need to rethink the questions for the next one. Ranking products? I think most of your audience is more interested in Apple&#39;s vision for the future than how Tim Cook would rank iphones and ipads lol.
Tom Cook.  A shade of a blurry shade of Steve Jobs.
loved the mentioning of the magic mouse right after he said apple doesnt care about selling the most units and they rather produce the best products yet this abomination exists.
They killed Steve.
It’s cool to see these interviews and all but when you have the chance to speak to a tech CEO you have to ask them about what they plan to do to divest from the apartheid colony of Israel. You have to pressure them on that even though their answer is “not much” right now.  These people of power and influence in the business world cannot sleep in peace until we get tangible commitments.
Tim isn&#39;t cooking 💀
Apple supports Israel’s army IDF. That’s absolutely disgusting!
Missed a chance to ask Tim’s reaction as Apple will be soon overtaken by MKBHD in subscribers on YouTube
You  mean Apple Intelligence right.
"Hold up, Let the man cook"
"Not really tough questions but hey, maybe next time 💪"
"I think Tim brought up a good point about the new way to view photos. I, too, thought of family members that have passed, and how this new technology could&#39;ve been a nicer way to remanence on memories."
You didn’t ask him to bring back Aperture?!?! What a lost opportunity.
Did Tim just not recognize a iPhone 15 pro?
"each word and point, amazingly calculated"
"This interview summary how Tim &quot;Apple&quot;, Sorry I mean Tim Cook, completely disconnected from reality of what is a product. he couldn&#39;t care less of what a product should be look like or what does ergonomics mean, if he really thinks Vision Pro is a good multi task device - its a frekn joke!, The dude only good in one thing. SUPPLY CHAIN, he can delivery devices across the planet on time with nice marketing and enough restriction to let you fall in the iMessages system (aka: Eco system).<br>After the interview Tim cook had to go back stage and check what is a Magic Mouse!<br>Tim cook is not a computer worker, meaning he work more with meetings and calls and emails than actually opening 10 different windows with 5 auto-cad files and 3 unreal engine at the same time while trying to edit some Photoshop work.<br>He open the computer like in the ads, for a luxury touch and they look nice and feel fancy! <br>I am SURPRISED people are taking the PRO name now as a standard. iPad Pro? like for real? any Pro actually studio level production work with iPad? <br><br>yes they are nice, but NO they are not ground breaking and no to mention other devices are easier faster and more productive than apples crap over priced , under powered computers!<br><br>The only reason Apple stuff famous on youtube, because its the ONLY platform where you need only built in Mac Apps to be able to start a channel.<br>But you can do NOTHING in the real work with apple products. no manufacturing, no real production not even real business networking."
"Whenever I watch videos like these, I remind myself Marques started reviewing phones in his bedroom - now he&#39;s interviewing the CEO of the biggest company on the planet. The progress is pretty incredible."
&quot;getting ergonomics for Magic Mouse was key&quot;<br><br>Marques smirked lmao
The cinematic zoom while talking about the &quot; ergonomics  &quot; of the f magic mouse is wilde<br>And MKBJD&#39;s smile is worth it lol
Putting wood behind an arrow is an interesting metaphor I haven’t heard before 🤔😊
"Never thought to see MKHBD and Tim Cook in the same room, just having a conversation of the new AI and WWDC key areas"
This interview is so cringe. So many things are said without saying it 😂
dry interview
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=600"">10:00</a> I was thinking  the exact same thing that Tim was giving such a LeBronesque answer regarding his legacy😊"
I hoped that marquess would dunk on the Magic Mouse…
Tim forgot for a moment the Magic Mouse existed.
After hearing Tim I can tell he’s the representative not the architect
you can see heart rate of Tim Cook jump(on his watch) when Marques ask about IA :)
WTF. it&#39;s over 9000
what is the name of tims shoes
"I&#39;m glad they cut in on your face whenever Tim was talking highly about a known lesser product and you had to hold in your smirks and giggles about how you feel.<br>(Magic mouse, vision pro, even the ai server on apple silicon comment)"
No such value coming hearing him. A polished business man talking marketing neatly.
He brought out an iphone in this video and samsung in other video about the WWDC!
Vision Pro landing in Canada has a base storage 256gb price at $5000 plus $700 for Apple Care…plus 13% tax here in Ontario….an additional $300 for the 512gb or $600 for the 1TB…I expect a whopping 500 sales nationwide for that thing 👌🏻
"Apple seems to have a strong commitment towards users privacy. It has been this way for years and now, they want to make &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; serve us by learning about our needs, and contrary to other AI, not also take advantage or find ways to monetize. If this is true, I&#39;m all for it. Awesome video Marques!"
The only reason Tim tells the story about the pictures of his parents is to adress emotions at potential buyers. Marketing at it&#39;s core
"out of respect, marques used his iphone in this interview.<br>he shoulda used his samsung"
Tim leaving the interview screaming at design team to make new magic mouse
Jargon and key words that means nothing.
"Hey Siri, I&#39;m giving you a second chance."
Oh boy the magic mouse moment KILLED MEE 😂
Tim was definitely caught off guard by the Magic Mouse 👀 😆
Tim doesn&#39;t even remember the mouse 😂
Why does he talk like that
This was rough on Cook&#39;s side. Dude can&#39;t answer a single question straight forward.
Bringing a Samsung as your phone would have been such a powermove tho lol
Tim feels so intimidated by Marques lol
What about open ais cutoff point as it is not updated and ai hallucinations
Mama I made it…
"Great moment for Marques, no doubt. But I learned nothing. That was corporate city, not even a peep of humanity or anything real. Marques could have asked chatgpt, pretend you are made of pure marketing and I&#39;ll interview you, go!"
Glad you didnt hold back on important questions.
Would like to see innovation in Apple Watch with AI to detect seizures (selfishly for my daughter ❤)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> crazy he has to check and Marques has to say it&#39;s a 15 XD"
Magic Mouse. The gall of it.
"&quot;Wow, Tim Cook talking to MKBHD. Guess Tim&#39;s career is really taking off now! 🚀"
* hears about magic mouse*<br>&quot; FINE I&#39;LL OPEN THE COMMENTS &quot;
"I am a new subscriber and I was blown away by the quality of your channel and how articulate you are. But here you are interviewing Tim Cook! Your questions were intelligent, informative and engaging. I hope the fact that Tim Cook loves his iPad as much as I do means that the iPad will be around for a long time. Great work! Thank you for this video."
no offense marques but i just lost 16 mins of my life tbh...
"It is rarely interesting an interview with an CEO, this was dull as one  could expect, but thanks for teying Marques"
I kind of dislike how ceos speak like politicians :/
That hand shake released positive energy all over the interview
"I wish wwdc was actually for developers rather than stockholders , I wish they cared about customers and developers as much as they care Bout shareholders <br><br><br>Apple is still using a small part of ai with machine learning and general large language models only being a small part <br>With things like gan neural networks as they were able to learn the game super mario by using evolutionary neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)<br><br>With apple intelligence and machine learning it is only a small part of ai <br>As with the vast gamit of neural networks and other areas such as np <br><br>Why is it apple has tacked on ai rather than building it operating system from the ground up from everything from all the core apis , to the file system using ai as i would love to generate new icons or with a file system that uses neural networks or the metal framework <br><br>As apple intelligence seems tacked on"
"Get an engineer to talk about it, AI and the stuff. This ceo guy just talks politics i can guess all he talked."
I love how we learnt absolutely nothing about anything even tho he &quot;answered&quot; every question.<br>&quot;So how do you assure that the data sent from the iPhone to the cloud stays private?&quot;<br>&quot;The cloud runs on Apple chips&quot;
Apple who always avoids any 3rd party services and even hardware it&#39;s strange they go full in with Chat-GPT
The look when Tim discusses the magic mouse. You should have asked him about the charging port’s location.
MKBHD Should have used a galaxy instead... that would have been wild
"Apple using ChatGPT is the biggest White Flag Apple has ever did! Really disappointing.<br>Also, a big privacy risk! Regular users don’t understand the meaning in sending information to Apple cloud vs sending it to OpenAi!<br>Obviously Apple is in a tough place, they came late to the AI game, yet they just have to use this shortcut.<br>Personally, I think its gonna backfire sooner or later."
"Private Cloud Compute should have been named Private Cloud Processing, so we could all say we use PCP."
"This is amazing! Thank you Marques for interviewing Tim Apple! <br>You can definitely see that Apple has a different mindset/market for their products. Not first to the market, but they want to be the best or very well done. <br><br>Love the privacy focused part of the questions asked. Everyone is trying to get your data and information now, makes me want to stick to Apple to at least have my information secured"
אפל תייצר Vision Pro עם מסך 4D עם זכוכית מיוחדת טים ושבב 4D למשך למשחקים ומוסיקה ווידאו וסרטים.
"The reaction from Marques when Tim mentioned &#39;ergonomics&#39; and &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; in the same sentence 😂 😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> you can see that he was about to comment on it but then changed his mind and moved on to ask Tim about the iPhone."
Cook is extremely out of touch with Apples consumers. He seems like a good guy but he just lacks the charisma and most importantly the forward-thinking of Jobs.
Yeah go tell Palestinians that privacy is a human right
"that look after he talks about ergonomics on the magic mouse has got to be the highlight of this<br>my mom has used the magic mouse for like since it came out and i do not understand how, ive started using the logitech lift and im never going back to a regular mouse if i can help it, let alone the magic mouse"
One of those videos when you&#39;re glued to the screen. Thanks MKBHD
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=84"">1:24</a> Yeah, improve people&#39;s lives<br>Sure 😊 MKB"
He feels like a corrupted politician
Dude is just walking ad
apple needs to demote tim and hire MKBHD as CEO. He would complete the world domination of apple
I don’t think Tim understood the game. 😂
Especially those ergonomics while charging...
Apple is closing the gap with Samsung
"If Apple keeps human nature at the core of their generative AI efforts, we&#39;ll see enormous potential. If used to replace the need for humans, I&#39;d prefer mankind go without it altogether."
"Apple does do what they do. They&#39;re great at innovation, but they&#39;re better at making things look pretty and being easy to use."
Legit probably the only good interview ever done with an Apple exec. Thank you Marques!
"No Doubt , Marcus was suckin up with iPhone 15 sittin on the chair arm. I get it, he wants access to this powerful man, but we all know you daily Galaxy’s! Lol"
apple worked so hard to build their own silicon and its not even enough so they rely on chatgpt wat is not apple tho xD how to trust apple? i feel as an apple user they lost their vision xD they feel weakened and breaking down i never felt this much trust broken everyone know chatgpt would found you no matter what and will still be able to store your data so big privacy apple does respect your data but thats not anymroe the case sad
was not expecting Clone Wars III on the intro 🔥🔥🔥
I just wish they didn&#39;t have the walled garden and then I wouldn&#39;t be anti apple. I feel like I&#39;m going to be trapped if I go there.
"bs interview, no hard questions, can;t take anything out of this"
Tim should feel honored to be on MKBHD channel.
I spend so much time on my galaxy watch3 trying to use voice to text. It doesn&#39;t understand me a lot of the time.
That&#39;s a tough game for a CEO lol. Ranking can be seen as shitting on a product to some employees or audience members.
Ask him is he afraid of losing his job of AI next time)
You definitely said AI like 100 times in the first 30 seconds just to troll Apple didn‘t you 😂?
"if when he talk about vision pro and one  of the  thing he said is photos, that mean isn&#39;t really fof me cause i barely took time looking at my old pictures"
"man, looks like he completely forgot that the magic mouse existed"
Ed Snowden would be laughing out loud at this whole privacy thing because he himself exposed the truth.
Why does Tim fill out his shirt so well... 🤨💪
Fantastic interview and Tim did it extremelly Well . Down to earth with personal touch. Loved it. Thanks Marques
I can see Tim Cook right now looking at MKBHD reviews on the the Magic Mouse looking for answers
Ask him why the Jailbreak Scene is 10/15 years ahead of them ? 😂😂😂
Marques damn near burst out laughing when he said they had to get the ergonomics right on the magic mouse
Ergonomics and Magic Mouse are oxymorons…!!
It never fails to amaze me how much old southern people say “you know” to fill gaps in their thinking.
"They say you should never meet your heroes, but in this case, I think Tim is happy he did"
great interview
"Hold on, I thought you were using the samsung during the WWDC event?"
"I have a vague feeling of friendliness towards Mr. Cook, but to be honest I&#39;m not sure why. He maintains an unbreakable level of aloofness to any meaningful conversation outside of the brand&#39;s approved messaging. Which some would argue is the job of an executive in his position, but it&#39;s still always a bit disappointing."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=340"">5:40</a> - Dude, I can&#39;t watch this shit.  There&#39;s nothing &quot;private&quot; about any cloud.  The moment I heard Tim Cook utter that baldfaced lie, I had to stop."
My dude. Love your success and critical thinking of this strange technology that is now part of our life
"The subtle zoom when mentioning “ergonomics” and “Magic Mouse”, and the smile from Marques knowing this was a total PR answer. Peak production right there! But then fantastic response in the interview as well, no questioning it, just knowing that’s as far as you’re going to get out of the CEO of the company. No pushing further, no prying, just the mention. That is fantastic journalism, and it’s why Apple agrees to an interview with MKBHD. Bravo! 👏"
I can&#39;t believe you got Tim Apple on the channel
Tim closed all his rings..
"it’s nice to see how Tim’s mind is still sharp, his replies where intelligent"
what a disingenuous guy lmao
Am I the only one who believes that every single word that came out of Tim&#39;s mouth during the top 5 product listing was all bullshit?
unc didn&#39;t rate them lol
Why is no one mentioning the fact that he didn’t even play the blind ranking game at the end. Marques just listed them all off for him without hearing his ranking! That would have been fun
After this Marques isn&#39;t geting another interview with him 😂dude got him with the vison pro
Okay markaaaaas brownlee hittin it big
What was the point of the raking game if the man didn&#39;t even rank it?
“I’ve been talking to Tim for the past 2 weeks”
"No disrespect for Tim, but I would‘ve loved to see MKBHD talk to Steve Jobs. Tim is like a politician, nothing interesting to be honest"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> tim himself didnt know which one it was 💀"
This is rad. Kudos
Apple is done
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=740"">12:20</a> It&#39;s so funny to watch Tim cook cooking what to say about the magic mouse 😂"
let Tim Cook let Tim Coook
הDynamic Island יכיל מצלמה עם יותר פוקוס כמו במצלמה האחורית לצילומים ווידאו טוב יותר ופטנט לפייסטיים גם באייפד ובמק ואפל Vision Pro באייפון 16 בקילר רעיון תעבדו מהר כמו במצלמה האחורית לעבודה או באייפון 17 בפטנט. ותעבוד על מצלמות חסכוניות יותר בסוללה ברכיבים ותוכנה ושבב וקישוריות גם באייפון 16 גם המצלמה הקדמית. ותעבוד על שבב חסכוני יותר ברכיבים ותוכנה וקישוריות עוד יותר קשה גם בטסלה. כולל שבב סלולר.
Ergonomics had to be the last consideration for the magic mouse. Top priority was making sure it remained functional while charging. Oh wait..nvm
"Amazing words from both of you, well done Marques."
You made him say AI. Thats it for me. 🤣
"Right, so while he was too diplomatic to say it outright, sounds to me like his ranking highest to lowest is:<br>- iPhone<br>- MacBook Air<br>- iPad<br>- Vision Pro<br>- Magic Mouse"
This is just so cool..<br>Being able to talk with the CEO of Apple in a down to earth way for literally an hour.. <b>_</b>
Even with Mr. Cook... Curious how such an important interview didn&#39;t get the low frequency filtered out... that got my table rumbling! 😅
Magic mouse was the perfect setup
I love the Magic Mouse. Scrolling is a pleasure with it. We just need it to charge wirelessly with MagSafe.
"T: “That’s in the, well, that’s in the iPhone....”<br>M: “15, yeah...”"
"Tim Cook is the most boring CEO of big tech companies. It&#39;s not his fault, he is who he is."
I bet you were trying your hardest not to laugh when you mentioned the Magic Mouse 😂
Tim took Apple to another level<br>Of success.
This robot never goes off script. This company throttled your iphone for a decade to force you to buy a new one - and lied about. Privacy? The Chinese government won&#39;t even let Apple products into government buildings. Apple is not ethical. They&#39;re a sleazy company just like all the others. Their constant appeal to &quot;moral highground&quot; is laughable
everything great about Apple died with Steve Jobs
I bet he puts a lot of wood behind that arrow if you catch my drift!
the device from her is perfect. i dont care about the 3d holograms but just something i can say to do what i would be doing on the phone for me .. i dont care to be watching 4k video and to play games that kill the battery.   i want a straight up communication device... it needs at least a small screen to see web pages/... one thing i wanted to ask though for real.  with ai and the 3d images tim was talking about cant we generate complete 3d environments based off an image ?
"Great interviewer, so authentic and genuine and passionate !"
A Cook a day makes apple decay
I&#39;m wondering how the crew behind the camera held a straight face at magic mouse bit 😂
ooohh marques thank you so much for the magyc mouse moment! that was hilarious
First question: y a u gay?
See I don&#39;t trust anyone who can&#39;t make fun of themselves a little... He was giving Tim a slowball with the magicmouse.
Seemed like both Marques and Tim were both a bit off their game.  Maybe it was just a long day but neither were as energetic as I’ve seen them in the past.
the disappointment in Marques&#39;s face when Tim wouldn&#39;t even be unbaised towards the magic mouse was so funny.
"Awesome get Marques!  Great interview.  You should be a VP  at Apple   Maybe eventually more.  You’ve probably been offered.  I’m sure you want to maintain an unbiased point of view, but you’d be a massive asset there"
Tim: &quot; .. getting the ergonomics down right .. &quot;<br>Marquees: 🗿🗿
Was there a single hard hitting question besides apple mouse ergonomics?
This is like that book/show Interview with the Vampire.
so his ranking was basically:<br><br>1 - iPhone<br>2 - iPad<br>3 - MacBook Air<br>4 - Vision Pro<br>5 - Magic Mouse (judging by his reaction even he knows they failed there 😂l
Anyone else find it odd that Tim uses the default watch face? Nothing about him gives tech enthusiast or even curious about what&#39;s going on. He&#39;s just a name that takes credit for all the engineers doing.
&quot;Improving peoples lives&quot;<br>Life is arguably more shitty since smartphones and iPads
Let Tim Cook
Thanks tim. man such a cool job marq :)
"“Our objective wasn’t to be first, Our objective is to be the best!” <br><br>And that is what they are!<br><br>Cook -12/06/24"
Went about as &quot;corporate speak&quot; as I imagined it to be and more.😅🍎
"“Our objective wasn’t to be first, Our objective is to be the best!” <br><br>And that is what they are!<br><br>Cook -12/06/24"
Dude he didn’t even blind rank 😳🤦🏿‍♂️ FAIL
"Glad for Tim’s growth, now he speaks with the MKHB. What a remarkable achievement"
Tim finally said &quot;WINDOWS&quot; during Vision Pro review.
"Marques’s face when Tim started talking about the Magic Mouse Ergonomics 😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a>"
Didn&#39;t Apple make that whole Apple book that was 500 bucks??
Tim is very smart. He didn’t do the ranking because he didn’t want to portray that any of his products are inferior to another. Every answer felt like it was coming from a politician who carefully curated every response😂
haha there is no way tim cook uses vision pro 😄
Homerun Interview Marques!
I like Tymoteusz Kucharz
Talking to Tim about calculators
This was not a ‘puff piece’. Genuinely surprised and impressed by how far Marques pushed him on the answers
Tim Cook has been CEO of Apple for so long its almost feels like he extablished the organization!
Marques holding his tongue during the Magic Mouse conversation. Fix the Magic Mouse
Huge powerful bro ! 19M Cook accepte you 😂
You can see the exact moment Tim Apple goes &quot;Wait...We sell something called the Magic Mouse?&quot;
Tim cook: The art of saying a lot without saying anything.<br><br>The face of Marques when Tim speaks about the agronomics of the magic mouse is priceless 😂
I think asking Tim about the magic mouse was a trick question to see his reaction 😂
"It’s amazing how he did not answer a single question yet you feel satisfied with the interview, Tim is a pro"
"Ok, everything is AI these days and past days. Whatever happends next is so predictible..."
I see tim cook<br><br>I know this channel isn&#39;t for me
RIP steve
Mission passed:<br>Respect +
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> Tim: How do I sell the Magic Mouse?"
"Hey Marques!<br>can apple make simple different phone ring mode? say just ring or just silent or just vibrate on a click? I prefer my phone in two modes - only vibrate mode or only silent mode; can apply make option of turning on these different mode in a single click instead of going inside the silent mode and then from inside of it choosing whether to turn on vibration or not? Also I like their focus modes, but it would be so much easier if they can make phone on: ring or vibrate or silent on single click!!"
"Love how both mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss just casually post videos of the interviewing big ceos like Tim, Sundar, Bill like it&#39;s lightwork."
"You fed him a total dud with the Magic Mouse 😂, and you fucking knew it 😂"
That “Magic Mouse” moment defined this interview 😂😂😂😂😂☠️
Apple is going downhill from now on and it will reflex on the stock price 😂 <br>Ergonomics on the magic mouse… sign that they have absolutely lost focus🤣
This will probably be awkward
STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM!!!! LOOK AT GOD SHOWING OUT IN THIS MAN LIFE!!!! AMEN BROTHER!!! STAY AWESOME!!!
Who wants apple to start selling servers again?
Bro looking at tim cook like he about to eat him
"Tough questions. His speech achieved its slowest cadence when trying to talk about Magic Mouse. If next hardware release they revamp it, it’s because he went home pissed he was put on the spot about it 😂"
"Out of all things to mention about the Magic Mouse… the ergonomics? lol na. I see the trap you up him in there, MKBHD 😂"
I love how awkward they both are as if they are both so nervous to meet each other.
Magic Mouse: ergonomic? Tim did NOT Cook.
&quot;Our object is never to be first. our objective is to be best&quot;<br><br>And they&#39;ve achieved neither with this AI nonsense
it seems like the Magic Mouse was designed by someone who has never experienced having human hands before....yet I own two of them. curse you Apple!
Pro tip: Watch this video in 1.5x speed 😅
"I hate that many are mocking Apple for adding stuff Samsung and Google had 10 years ago.<br>It is not about how many features my phone has, they just do not need to add stuff like that because there might already be an app for that OR they just think they do not need it.<br>Also, google and samsung need to compete because they use android and they need to have fancy features to get ppl to buy their product. but there is only on phone on the market that runs a unix based kernel, and that is iPhone."
"&quot;Clone Wars III&quot; is crazy, I was just listening to that song in the car. Logic in 3 of your videos is even crazier. I am liking it 👍"
"unfortunately the magic mouse reference, shows that Tim is not aware of the community."
the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse have NO ergonomics whatsoever. that&#39;s a huge lost opportunity tbh
"So interesting how Tim is like talking as apple, idk how to describe it but he just gives the perfect apple answers…<br><br><br>So cool how he avoids the spicy questions and the whole ranking…<br><br><br>I don’t blame him though as an ceo, cuz one mistake can cost u millions…<br><br><br>"
‘Magic Mouse’. <br>Hmm. <br>Bro knew what he was doing and then some
The whole blind ranking thing went over Tim’s head… and I think nearly everyone else’s head too… was he just suppose to answer 1-5?
Don&#39;t you mean Tim Apple?
Be sure to drink your ovaltine.
"He was ready for everything, but when Marques pulled the magic mouse card, he crumbled😂"
Tim makes too much money for his teeth to look like that especially that bottom row
"Rare to see Tim outside of his comfort zone. Good questions, Marques."
"Can&#39;t lie, I use the Magic Mouse every day, it&#39;s the one mouse I&#39;ve had the LEAST strain with, the mouse is where your hand rests naturally, so IDK what the problem is..."
What can I say? I&#39;m cooked
I don&#39;t think Tim wanted to play
"I hoped Marques would ask hard hitting questions about AI.<br>What about the learning dataset? How was it sourced?<br>Do they see AI as art replacement, as they tried to advertise the iPad M4 as?<br>What&#39;s their policy on deepfakes?<br>What do they think the impact of gen ai will be on a mass scale? Won&#39;t it remove even more authenticity from the lives of everyday people?<br><br>Even the questions about privacy are surface level and don&#39;t delve deep.<br>Marques I appreciate you man but it&#39;s clear that you aren&#39;t a good interviewer, and Apple is abusing your audience to get free good press."
It aint a magic mouse. ITS A GODDAMN FLIPPING TRAGIC MOUSE!!!
"I don&#39;t get the hate for magic mouse, I like using it in terms of it&#39;s daily ergonomics, and it only takes 5 mins (to get a drink) while it charges for a day&#39;s use. Then I charge it over night for another 4-5 months of daily usage 🤷🏻‍♂ I&#39;d prefer it to be wireless charging which I had a version of for a while."
he got Tim to play the blind ranking game lol
this is just more marketing. these huge people can’t give any unfiltered interviews too sad.
Random thing… I just noticed when you up and down the volume it makes a bump next to the buttons on the screen 😂
Pretty sure Tim wanted to rank the Magic Mouse #10 out of 5
&#39;Ergonomics&#39;  best way to lie in an interview!
When is it louis Rossmanns turn.
he really compared his nephews and nieces to his favourite apple devices
Tim is really not a good speaker
"I get strange vibes from that. I know Marques foremost because &quot;one knows him&quot; and sometimes the algorithm brngs me something into the viewport even without a subscription. However I always had the feeling that there are influencers that act differently than others. Some act in relation to brands, others act in relation to viewers. I like the latter. <br>Interesting was my &quot;realisation&quot; that this interview showed I was right. <br>Marques seems smaller. Seems limiting himself towards a probably even more situationally insecure Tim Cook, that gets this ride done with some marketing speak. Why would he be so much smaller? And questions to the real thing about his legacy? Is this a CULT? &quot;Legacy&quot; is defined how Cook layed it out, that&#39;s common knowledge.🤣The most influencial influencer seems to be quite influenced. But never mind, I just came strolling by. I will be gone immediately, don&#39;t worry. <br><br><br>And... of course Apple is the best. One would be stupid not to buy and use their products. Or too poor. Anyway everyone can do what they please so leave me alone. Doesn&#39;t matter. Apple is good. I know that. I said nothing against Apple. And what would you say there, anyway??? Tell me! Or are you not REALLY the Apple guy? Do the others know? What would it be worth for you that the others don&#39;t know?"
i sit there with AI waiting and i have nothing. Nothing at all to ask AI.  Its pointless.
"I like Tim a lot. If Apple could take more risks and be a creative company instead of going for maximum profits, I&#39;d legitimately be one of their biggest fanboys."
"Rank the damn products, Tim!!"
-4000 aura for opening his mouth
&quot;We view privacy as a human right&quot; God damn it that means they don&#39;t care about it
Why bro pulled out the phone from other pocket this time?
...make 2D photos into 3D animated.... like Google Photo does?
Magic mouse😂😂
He is the biggest LGBTQ promoter without even mentioning it. He even wears it as a socks. smh
am I the only one who is not getting magic mouse ergonomics joke? Please somebody explain it to me Thanks in advance 😀
Some features I just really want include pinning our top 10 emojis to the front so you don&#39;t lost them and also facetime on macbook needs to be able to shrink the window on the screen more. It takes up just way too much of the screen
kudos to mkbhd for keeping a straight face during the magic mouse moment
I never realized how good LTT Riley&#39;s impression of Tim Apple is.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> In the Beninging"
Drink every time they say AI
I&#39;m still trying to understand... will there truly be no Apple Intellegence features available to the iPhone 15 (base model)? It feels very limited to say it&#39;s only 15 Pro and above that gets it. I literally just got a brand new 15 a few weeks ago.
AI has negative connotations. I was wondering if he would just say that. But he just skirted the obvious. Just goes to show how careful they are to not tarnish the brand
"You only get these interviews under very specific circumstances. You have to agree to a lot of red tape. Theses interviews are only ever good for the C-suite person being interviewed. They are trained like crazy for interviews like these, never to let anything slip. These interviews are always only marketing, too bad even Marques let&#39;s himself lure into bullshit like this..."
Right phone
This is a possible segway for Apple to create more AI driven services and bundle it into their Apple One subscription. Samsung is doing it. Google has done it.
Tim Cook sounds more like the head of marketing than the ceo
"A benefit to the user: The ability to install or side-load apps without Apple blocking or &quot;approving&quot; the process. This includes after support has ended, and in a fully offline environment."
The Magic Mouse killed me 😂
bro knew he was caping about the magic mouse ergonomics XD
Can someone zoom in on Tim Cook’s Heart rate on his watch? Is it a healthy 20BPM or 104BPM because of this interview?
Next interview Sam Altman!
"Great questions and predictably restrained, shareholder-centric  answers."
"This was a tense watch.<br><br>I feel Apple has been courting Marques in a way that&#39;s deliberative and patient, as Apple is. They give him products earlier, they start him off with executive, non-CEO interviews, they quote him in a keynote, and they give him exclusive access to their testing facility. This interview with Tim Cook is a culmination of this process, but it didn&#39;t go the way either side wanted.<br><br>Apple and MKBHD have an equal number of YouTube subscribers basically, and Apple knows his influence. It&#39;s not enough to break the company, but a sour relationship wouldn&#39;t be a nice thing for Apple.<br><br>Apple interviews are so, so buttoned and borderline rehearsed, but given MKBHD&#39;s scale and influence, he seemingly was granted a freedom I haven&#39;t seen given to others---even to Dua Lipa. Just see the candor of Brian Tong or an iJustine interview---or how Dave2D was treated when filming in Apple Park v how Marques was given a garden.<br><br>Of all the CEO interviews, Apple + Tim Cook have the most to chip at, especially with a tech reviewer knowing what being good to the consumer looks like via 15 years of reviewing hardware and software, and how Apple edges the entire user base of an excellent experience.<br><br>I am very fascinated by this video and the details are SO loud.<br><br>I am glad this interview happened, and all-in-all I am glad Marques has gone from Kobe to Tim, but boy is the top of this mountain frigid.<br><br>(I hope this comment doesn&#39;t get deleted; I am but a keen observer.)"
Lmao he cant rank anything.
Noob is talking with noob
stopped the interview after hearing magic mouse and ergonomics in one sentence. This is just marketing yapping
Lol oh yeah the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse.. so perfect
Volkswagen Detective Comics 24 🤧.
Lol the magic mouse........
Are you serious 😂😂😂
I&#39;m proud like when Obama was president ! As a black man✊🏾
Tim Cook can u please fix the navigation gesturing so I can swipe left to go back in any app. Please. Its one of the main reasons I prefer android
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
I&#39;m just wondering why I absolutely love the Magic Mouse. Going to any other non multitouch mouse feels like going back to the 90s.
AI + users of Pegasus...nefarious nefarious nefarious!
The whitest sneaker….
Pretty sure the magic mouse is the most popular mouse to use when ordering a MX Master from Logitech to replace your ridiculous magic mouse...
"I want to go to WWDC just so I can shout, &quot;Hey, Siri, set an alarm for 5 seconds from now,&quot; in an auditorium full of Apple users."
C&#39;mon! We all deserve more than just a 16 minutes of this interview!
W
I respect MKHB so much more as a journalist after watching this. You can see Tim really struggling to bend the logic of some of his tough questions
I giggled when Marques said “the Magic Mouse.” That has to be the worse Apple product. Even Steve had to look up to think about it 🤣🤣🤣
The iPhone’s ranking was OMG!
"If you are a culture that holds the defence of free will as paramount - your interest in the influence of past over one&#39;s future is limited.  The problem is, if free will does not exist, the appetite we have for it is insatiable by definition - and appetites that can not be satisfied are ultimately corrosive for those who hold them.   &quot;I&quot;Phone, &quot;I&quot;Pad, etc - positioning the self as the central point of meaning requires an undeniable Free Will - this is why he says he doesn&#39;t look in the rear view mirror - because accepting the need to look at one&#39;s own  history - would need to accept that history defines us - and that denies this absolute autonomy."
Tim Apple*
He sounds like gay Joe Biden
"Terrible interview. Tim Cook gave only vague responses. Clearly, he’s more of a businessman than a tech enthusiast. I wanted to know about iPadOS, but since he said the Magic Mouse is ergonomic, everything else is nonsense."
"It’s incredible seeing Marques in interviews like this while remembering videos with Cheerios background in the dorm room like they were released yesterday. It’s truly heartwarming. <br><br>Also, Tim is a completely different animal here compared to Keynote. While still conservative in answers as a responsible CEO should be, he sounds like a solid partner for discussion. I wish the scripted keynotes didn’t dehumanize him so much turning him into happy boomer grandpa that happens to be in charge of tech. Whoever is responsible for keynotes, let the Tim Cook! Sounds so much better when being natural."
"Wow, how did Marques get an interview with Ellen DeGeneres?"
"Tim Cook is great man. He had enormous shoes to fill and he over delivered! I do not think there should be chatter about the next CEO of Apple for some time, I hope Tim has it in him to lead Apple 5-10 more years."
"Tim is great at keeping a poker face and brushing off reality. Privacy? Tell all of us that have traded our sold old iOS devices &amp; find out old photos can show up. Ergonomics &amp; the magic mouse are polar opposites. That&#39;s like saying the qwerty keyboard is the most efficient when it was purposefully designed to show you down. Does the magic part refer to Mickey designing it while on psilocybin? My father worked on ergonomics and designed keyboards. If he heard the magic mouse was ergonomic, he&#39;d tell you that you never used it."
"We need a new Genius Radical leader again, Tim is only a great accountant, not any visionary.<br>Let Tim run the board, get a new Steve Jobs for these shows.<br>We love apple"
Apple is going on a propaganda tour.
Tim Apple
"You are the only youtuber that i watch on full screen, great as always"
Huge
The Magic Mouse glare was diabolical 😂
You could atleast iron your shirt marques
Tim clearly hasn&#39;t watched your videos on Magic Mouse lol
"For someone that’s suppose to be intelligent, he didn’t play the game right! Smh"
"@Marques, Did Apple ask you to change your pixel pro during the interview😂? Or finally you are convinced to move to apple world."
"Man he is really proud of not having a museum on apple campus, he said the exact same bar in his iJustine interview"
Bruh the subtle editing during the &quot;Magic mouse&quot; part deserves an award
wow Tim got to meet Marquez!? yo Tim has made it in life🔥
3.9K
Imagine he did this interview while reading from an android phone lol
I have nothing against Tim Cook but damn is he boring! 😂
Both LOL at word &#39;Magic Mouse&#39;
LETS BLOCK THEM.
"The description of this video says you talk about Siri, yet you don&#39;t. Immediate video dislike."
"- as  in the apple iPhone <br>- it’s 15<br>- yea, I know <br><br>😂😂😂"
I am so glad I uploaded my phone to the 15 pro max! It should be called AI for the rich because it’s only available on 15 pro and pro max 😊
"What do you use it for? ehmmmmmmm cough cough, &quot;entertainment&quot;."
&quot;With magic mouse? ok...&quot;
MKBHD&#39;s reaction when Tim talks about ergonomics of the Magic Mouse was priceless.
You shoulda ask him to do a ‘what’s on my iPhone’ hit. I would love to know what Tim’s setup is.
Those adoring eyes of Marques’s in the thumbnail all for Timbo ❤❤❤
bro is wearing nike glasses...
even thor can&#39;t lift tim cook from his well planned strategy to actually play blind ranking. futile attempt.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> that &quot;Bro, what the hell are you talking about&quot; moment in the interview."
"An excellent interview which Tim handled incredibly well considering. He was thrown some real hardballs and handled them the best he could. Remember, he not only represents Apple. He is the current face of Apple. Speaking openly negatively about any current product would be a PR disaster. The same could be said about anyone. Apple were brave enough to do this. Tim was brave enough to do this."
Marques did not hold back!
Nice AI generated interview with Tim
You would think a million dollars ceo of a tech company would be well spoken. No uhhh aaahh uuumms.he seems really confused or foggy about what ai + apple will deliver past we will have AI  and it will be integrated.
Marques setup Tim with the magic mouse and Tim trolled back with the ergonomics 😂
"I can&#39;t for the waveform Podcast this friday to get the boys&#39; reaction to the &quot;Magic Mouse&quot; moment <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=772"">12:52</a>"
Nice Tim Apple
Came straight to the comments after that &quot;Magic mouse&quot; segment😂😂
Thank you for being our voices. Great job as always. And the tough questions part what a question? Oh boy just getting started. I think the Vision Pro comment with the past in regard to Tim’s parents was invaluable. Like time travel in my opinion. How do you buy back memories??? Great finally
Private = Buzz words
"No wonder he is the CEO of Apple, he SLAYYEEDD through the interview like a cold Sword through melted butter."
Funny how Tim called it &quot;the iPhone&quot; instead of just iPhone.
magic mouse.... ergonomics.... key!?!?! WTF is he smoking?!?!
I thought Marques used Android. I man he always said he did. But what do I see here?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a><br>&quot;.. basic architecture as the Silicon that&#39;s in the, well, that&#39;s in the Iphone&quot;<br>&quot;15 ya&quot;<br>LOL"
"Tim, it&#39;s boooorrrriiiiing!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=856"">14:16</a><br>Me: why not the polishing cloth😢"
Who let this man cook
It is interesting to hear him say they picked OpenAI as being the safest option. The bar is so incredibly low lol
A tool
Tim : &quot;We don&#39;t look at the past...&quot;<br>Also Tim : &quot;being able to go back is an experience you can&#39;t replicate&quot;
I have to say I admire Tim Cook. His way of speaking and explaining seems so real
"I can’t believe someone as intelligent, capable and accomplished as Tim Cook mispronounces a common word. “Eckstablished”. A hard K sound that is not supposed to be in the word ‘established’. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=663"">11:03</a> <br>This is like when people say “Eckspecially”. I hate that! So cringe."
Private cloud compute - PCC and Chatgpt are separate
I imagine Marques built his entire interview around trying to slip the Magic Mouse question in there
Thank you for being the only person do these interviews that didn’t lob him nothing but softball questions.
What a ranking! 😂
lol it is the most Tim Cook thing in the world to participate in a blind ranking and refuse to participate.
Tim: We don&#39;t like looking back - Marcus: Let&#39;s look back :=)
"Wow, every product is a magical moment and the best that Apple has ever made . . ."
"Yes! So true, I couldnt live without my IPad mini, the creative tool that has unleashed my creativity"
"The camera placements, the lightings, the zoom, everything is perfect especially the indirect attacks Marquess pulls up 😂"
Pretty sure they will be releasing a new magic mouse soon with that answer.
Magic Mouse was the best part
"This is the Tim Cook AI, created by Apple for interviews. His training data was not sufficient enough to answer magic mouse well."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a><br>LOL😂"
"I really liked this interview, until Tim mentioned the ergonomics of the magic mouse as something that he felt they got right. 😂😂😂"
Why is everyone talking about the Magic Mouse 🐁
NO WAY MARQAZ JUST TROLLED THE CEO OF APPLE IN AN INTERVIEW LMFAO
The ergonomics of the magic mouse
Excellent Interview Marques!!! Thank you!!!!
"&quot;Magic mouse&quot;  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> I feel bad for Tim Cook"
Really great interview - Apple are leading the way with the ML / AI learning in my opinion now with their implementation. But Marques asked meaningful questions and provided prompts to go a bit deeper. Enjoyed this a lot.
"Should have asked about the notification situations on ios, pausing a video while recording and auto brightness shortcut. Even going back from page to page , the placement is different for each app. They need to keep a dedicated position for going back. All these work seamlessly on Android...hope they fix it ios.  I hope YouTubers could share a light on these things while they talk to the company people."
"Not one question about ecology..  a few years left before the copper pic , most of the other metals will engoing the same pic extraction in the 5, 10, 20 years and no one cares... <br>It&#39;s so disptopian that no one cares about the real work..."
"Very well done! Everyone else seems to have had fun with the &quot;Magic Mouse&quot; gag, but I really enjoyed watching Tim play. Marques asked genuine questions and allowed Tim to think while answering. In the end, it was watching Tim&#39;s &quot;Rosebud&quot; moment while speaking of his parents and Vision Pro that answered the question about Mr. Cook&#39;s legacy. Thank you, Mr. Brownlee."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> MKBHD back at it again trying to fail a small company 😢"
"One of the good qualities of a CEO is to be able to beat around the bush when answering a question. The more you can, the higher you climb the corporate ladder."
Tim is one of those Physics teachers who beat around the problem to make themselves think they solved it.
"Don’t get me wrong, the Magic Mouse is the prettiest mouse I’ve ever laid my eyes on. That being said, even Tim Cook couldn’t convince me that it’s “ergonomic”."
It’s so inspiring to see how far you’ve come throughout the last decade and more. Great interview.
I’m so glad MKBHD is giving his time to interview small content creators :)
Talk about why Nigeria not having access to TV+
That subtle zoom on the Magic Mouse was hilarious. The restraint of Marques is boundless
Hi Tim <br>Please make Things Cheaper
Great to hear from Tim Apple
My boi Marques grilling Tim Cook. Love it
Tim Cook is one of my favourite CEO’s in the world and he is the best in the business
I don&#39;t use Apple products because I don&#39;t like their closed eco-system but when it comes to the big players they are the ones I mistrust the least regarding AI solutions. All the others players are way too eager and are likely going to make dangerous mistakes.. I think there is a chance Apple does that to but at least they seem to be thinking before they jump every step of the way.
imagine Marques bringing his android the next time he&#39;s at an apple interview😂
The magic mouse 😭😭😭😭
Thanks to LTT and especially Riley can&#39;t help giggling whenever I hear Tim Cook speaking
"Would have been nice to hear real questions too. Concerning the real effect of the company&#39;s politics and actions, their ramifications regarding society and the environment. But Apple wouldn&#39;t answer those anyway. Everything was an incredible achievement, and equally important, even the useless designer mouse, which looks cool, nothing more."
BRO THAT MAGIC MOUSE MOMENT WENT CRAZY
nice and intersting interview! thanks a lot!
The magic mouse 🤣🤣🤣.. and the close ups at that moment 🤣
"I must say I&#39;m rather disappointed in the top 5 section. After Tim failed to rank the first 2 you switched up to &quot;my number 3&quot;. Plus, you really let him slide on the mouse. Other than that, not too bad."
Marques is very aggressive in this interview be it the body language or the question selection and pace or be out of the tone interview. Masques is in control.
"RIP Jobs. Cook is not the guy, at least on any visionary level."
"I found it funny that when Tim Cook mentioned that they don&#39;t have a museum, I guess at Apple campus or anything like that. It made me remember how bout the Apple book that had sort of a history of Apple with old Apple devices. Hmmm lol"
Timmy Cooks and MKBHD 😭🔥🔥
"Funny, he didn’t want to assume you were carrying an iPhone 🤣"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=127"">2:07</a> In the beninging in the beginininig :D"
"Honestly, this is the issue I have with CEOs in general. I&#39;d have way more respect for CEOs if they came out and said &quot;You know what, that has it&#39;s place, but I have to be honest, I didn&#39;t believe in this product when the concept was created.&quot; Or &quot;I have to be honest, I know people use their apple watch a hell of a lot, but it&#39;s not something I use because I don&#39;t like having my wrist feeling cluttered&quot;<br><br>Or something, basically if CEOs weren&#39;t so calculating in the way they spoke, I&#39;d be a hell of a lot more likely to actually want to spend even more money with their companies than the way Tim speaks in this.<br>Especially when it comes to the blind ranking. I was just left sitting here thinking &quot;OMG, come on, just play the game. Stop thinking that if you place a certain product at the bottom of your personal ranking it&#39;ll reflect badly on the company or that product."
Vision os my future take is youll eventually be able to go inside the photo and feel like you are in it
"ok in his defence the magic mouse only had one iteration that was fucked by the charging port, i think tim understood the question as the product line instead of the one model"
"In a nutshell, Cook says the Vision Pro is used to look at photos in a different way. In other words, you pay $3,500 to look at photos in a different way. Interesting!"
Including apple polishing cloth or those mac wheels in the game might close all doors for Marques
He REALLY did not care for the magic mouse omg xD &quot;idk the ergonomics was key or something&quot;
just casually saying DUB DUB instead of WWDC in front of Tim is a flex.
"The problem with using private compute for context and OpenAI for general knowledge is that these need to be blended, constantly. <br>“Is my wife’s name shorter or longer than the national average?”<br>“Does my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> appointment mean I have to miss watching the Tour De France?”<br>“Add the ingredients to my grocery list for France’s top 3 meals”<br><br>These all require both local access and broad world knowledge"
I&#39;m pretty sure you mean Tim Apple not Tim Cook. 😆
"I find this so entertaining, he is just selling, not having a human experience."
Just zoomed in on his face for the mouse. Hahahah
Great Interview
Tim “This isn’t a museum… you won’t find us reminiscing… we’re focused on the future” <br><br>Apple: releases $300 book of every apple product
SIRI SUCKS! Always tells me to LOOK AT YOUR PHONE!!
"I can see you are not completely honest in conversations with people from Apple. You always have something catchy to ask about and later use it in future videos. Why are you like this, Marques? Can’t you ask questions honestly?"
Thank you so much
Tim looked awfully nervous going into the interview. The responses lack confidence and many of them seem hand wavy. Apple has missed the gun when it comes to AI and their partnership with OpenAI is indicative of offering a draw in this game of chess.
Tension 🖱️🪤
Tim Cook is masterful at being prepared to answer practically any question that comes his way. Well done 💪🏿
MKBHD you fuckin legend
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> even Tim Cook couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the iPhone 15 and any other one😂"
I wonder if they made MKBHD use an Iphone in this interview because most videos he uses Android (S24 ultra as of late) lol
Magic Mouse is not Mickey Mouse
"Did he even answer any of the questions? I just heard some crazy words I don&#39;t understand, that&#39;s all, except for Marques, I understood him😅"
not appreciating the &quot;privacy&quot; comments
GOOD MORNING
"I like how keeps trashing and bashing apple , then he goes to meet with the CEO to talk about innovation 🤷"
Great questions. I’m glad you didn’t pull any punches!
THE MAGIC MOUSE AHAHAHAH
bro set up Cook on the magic mouse! ffs😆
who let tim cook
MKBHD is a goat
Good question would have been: will the proud owners of a brand new iphone 15 (not pro) be stuck with dumb Siri forever then?
It’s always interesting to hear things directly from him. I’ve always really liked Tim.
1.  How was that even a ranking? It felt like he was just marketing any product that was mentioned.<br>2.. Wish Marques inquired more about  idea behind designing that weird mouse.
"“Our model is one of; we want to empower you to do the things you couldn’t do without the tool”<br>- Yeah, like surfing brain rot social media posts all day and the ability to watch porn from your pocket…"
"an no way he got the ceo apple on his YouTube, legend"
MKBHD indirectly suggesting to have a museum and put last apple mouse on display.
Honestly just so proud of our boy getting to this level in his career! The man is sitting across from MKBHD and clearly starstruck!
It’s so boring listening to Tim…. Dude always thinking about being careful and strategic of what to say over being relatable and authentic.
Camera-person knew exactly what they were doing when they zoomed in on his face when Cook was cooking the ergonomics..
"Yes, the iconic all-time technology innovation of the magic mouse. Well done. Apple🎉😂"
"Marques didn&#39;t care he was talking to the CEO of Apple, he stood on bisness about that magic mouse nonsense😤"
I don&#39;t think Marques will ever lose in a &quot;don&#39;t laugh&quot; challenge
Thanks for actually asking hard questions and not just giving him an easy time because he&#39;s Tim Apple.
this is evil Marques
I wanna believe in my heart that Steve Jobs would be so proud of what Tim has done with Apple.
I thought Tim was contempleting about disowning Magic Mouse as a n apple product
I HATE APPLE
"give us a fucking rank Tim Apple, dont fail miserably"
Kudos for not cracking up in that magic mouse moment 😂
Hearing Tim talk about all of these legendary Apple products that changed the industry and were “first time products” and risks for the company Makes me realize it has been a long time since Apple has released a product like the ones mentioned in this video. Maybe one day the Vision Pro will be that
Has MKBHD turned into another Apple authorized retailer?
"Tim really didn’t answer any questions, but Marques got’em good with Magic Mouse. That was funny"
Marques should’ve brought S24 Ultra to the interview but okay😂
See I wish you had a little bit more of the journalistic fire in you. I would have EASILY challenged that ergonomics of that mouse. Steve from GN would have caught him off guard so quick 🤣
"First talking to Craig about the iPad calculator, then the magic mouse with Tim... Maybe Marques can get them to make a better one now 💡"
Tim Apple haha
"Dang, I missed Steve so much. Can’t imagine what will happen to this world if he’s still alive 😢"
Marquees blew it with the favorite things. Was obvious Tim was really uncomfortable with that. What was the point?
I would have gotten better answers from a piece of wood
Tim will be Apples downfall.
Marques knew what he was doing when he went and mention magic mause lol
I can&#39;t believe this is the boy i used to watch yeaaaaaaars ago with cereal in the background... Congrats fam.
They&#39;re calling it apple intelligence only to make it feel like a product of apple saying AI for them Is too general they had to accessorize it
"That is priceless, the magic mouse? 😂😂😂😂😂"
"WOW, that was an incredible look into Apple product design ethos."
Apple Watch and Apple air tags
Tim should be a politician. He just never answers any question 😂
Magic mouse and ergonomics 😅 Can he not admit its year-to-date the most awkward peripheral device on the market? It’s cool for a CEO to say we f-ed up 👍😎
Click like if you think that was a great interview 👍
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=751"">12:31</a> The video editing was brilliant"
bro did not remember what the magic mouse was.
"To requote Tim&#39;s quote about the MacBook Air and listen to the Vision Pro: &quot;The Vision Pro was not created to sell but to set a foundation&quot;<br>It was really about making a movement! Making a statement of Apple&#39;s innovative intension! And this makes a lot of sense. One of the biggest reasons the Vision Pro isn&#39;t a huge hit (yet) is 1 because of the price, losing a big audience just because it is quite pricy. And 2 because the App assortiment is just not there yet. A completely new OS system means that all the Apps you like need to be recoded for it to work on VisionOS, this takes time!"
its no longer called artificial intelligence. its now called apple intelligence
I’m a mini presidential historian and I wanna make photos of the presidents doing things they would do lol
"I don&#39;t know about you, but I feel some discomfort in Tim&#39;s voice"
Apple Apple Apple ... what about den Sony Phone :)
I’m deriving Tim’s blind ranking as<br>1 iPhone<br>2 iPad<br>3 MacBook Air<br>4 Vision Pro<br>5 Magic Mouse…
"Magic mouse still as dumb as people who buy it. Tim also sponsored by nike apparently. I dont like these pre planned interviews, “the tells us again why you awesome interviews”. I like the attack ones, why the mouse still charges from the bottom and it hurts to use, why ipados is so limited and file managing still sucks, what percent of vision pro sales have been returned… etc…"
Can’t believe you got a interview with Tim Cook really good interview
He is the only guy who can trash Apple and still get an interview 😅
Biggest interview of his life. Well done @MKBHD
"He made it!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk"">00:00</a> second into the video, &#39;bout to watch, but had to say!"
Tim: Getting the ergonomics done well was the key ..<br><br>Marcus trying to hold his expression 😅😅
You did him dirty with Magic Mouse
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=257"">4:17</a> goatse reference"
"For all people that always criticism Apple, Tim just said it: They don&#39;t want to be FIRST, then want to be the BEST."
"Apple mouse yeah? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> <br>Had to make the ergonomics well, yeah yeah <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a>"
Nicely done.
"Apple, just don&#39;t let Tim speak publicly again..."
"Why, just say that nobody liked it, just say it!! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a>"
"MKBHD: magic mouse <br>Tim: It was also an incredible moment, getting the ergonomics done right ......<br><br><br>Me 😮 ok i am out🚶🚶🚶"
"Trolling him with the Magic Mouse was the best, shows how disconnected he is!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=546"">9:06</a> This position, I feel, is what separates Kojima from Miyazaki. At least publicly. Both make great games but only one publicly reminds us of their legacy. I think people lean more towards perceived humility so this is a shallow take on my part, at best, because I don’t know for sure how either man really is in private."
Tim does not use the vision pro at all 😅
I feel like I&#39;m listening to a politician
no &quot;You&#39;re the man&quot; this time. but still a fun watch regardless!
"Is it just me... or is there more people watching this and thinking &quot;man, if only Steve Jobs was alive&quot;? Marques interviewing Steve would&#39;ve been incredible! So sad we never got it..."
He still did not give the ranking 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> Marques slowly dies inside"
Ew
I was laughing at the Magic Mouse segment 💀 <br><br>So many times MKBHD has said it’s the worse ergonomic product in the lineup. <br><br>Maybe a follow up would have cleared thing up.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> bro same"
Magic mouse was a trap😅
Marques este mai tare decat toate televiziunile din lume.
A ‘Lebron answer” would never be about supporting a successor 😂
He knew himself magic mouse sucks ass
Magic Mouse and The camera zoom <br><br>Million views right there
Marques why didn’t you give you condolences to Tim 🧑🏾‍💻
Gotta appreciate the Dubdub rebranding elevator pitch
This is more interesting and fun to watch than the actual WWDC24
that zoom in on the magic mouse question KILLED me 🤣
Let&#39;s take a moment to appreciate how far Marques has come. Interviewing some of the world&#39;s most influential ppl is no small feat. Great job! 👏
Marquez almost lost it when Tim Cook said the ergonomics of the magic mouse were just right 😂😂.
If Apple doesn’t have a museum or a device library how do they prevent from repeating mistakes? It pays to know history especially your own. I know off Apple University internally for employees but what else. Just curious how Apple passes on institutional knowledge.
Never looking backwards but everytime mentioning our new chip is 1000x faster than 1st one and so on )))
in apple&#39;s defense . you arent suppose to rest your hand on the mouse. it has trackpad on it so it has to be as flat as possible. so they kinda got the ergo right if you are using it the way it was intended
Tim got Cooked lol 😂
“How so?” I like that! The way you said was like You are basically saying it will create issues.
"I really loved this interview! I absolutely love MKBHD&#39;s push to harder questions and how open Tim Cook was to respond very clearly and directly. I didn&#39;t sense a whole lot of question dodging! Good work here! I would love more videos like this, so absolutely cool."
Wait.. did Tim not understand the game of blind ranking? He just said how each thing was important to the company but failed to give them a rating!
If I had to guess his ranking would be<br>1. iPhone <br>2. Vision Pro<br>3. Mac book air<br>4. iPad<br>5. “Ergonomic” Magic Mouse
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marquees&#39; face when Tim said getting the ergonomics right, was the key to the magic mouse 😂"
"He needs to be asked why it took so long to embrace RCS, and now that they are embracing it, why not the version that Android phones use? Likely their implementation of RCS is still going make chat/text interoperability w/ Android users continue to be suboptimal, which is anti-consumer, pro-company."
It feels like he&#39;s talking to a robot or a chatgpt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> ...  💭we are never inviting you back ... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=112"">1:52</a>"
"Anyway, moving on.  I’ve got some incredible news. We are adding a calculator to the iPad! 👏🏻👏🏻"
Bedroom reviews to interviewing the largest company&#39;s CEOs! Long time fan and love the journey man! Keep up the great work!
Had to watch this at 1.5 speed because Tim talks so slowly it was killing me!
"The way he says, &quot;the magic mouse &quot; right after Tim talks about ergonomics as if he can&#39;t believe that they&#39;re still talking about the magic mouse and has to reaffirm it."
Marques is BRAVE. If he didn&#39;t get invited again we all know why 😅
vvvvvvvvvv
I&#39;m amazed how Marques maintained his composure while Tim said &quot;Magic mouse&quot; &amp; &quot;ergonomics&quot; together 😂
I&#39;m curious if there were any questions you asked that he wasn&#39;t willing to answer. He very politely declined to rank the Apple products which I&#39;m not surprised about.
Why is he sitting on your lap in the thumbnail? Or are you like right behind him to the right? Biggest tech channel and such ass thumbnail design.
Oh… we see how it is… bust out the iPhone while talking to Tim but not the Android that we all know you primary… 😜
"Tim is an operations guy, and it shows in many of the products. Little innovation, just performance bumps with saving money, improving supply chain (not made in USA). Steve was a solid marketer, and also knew what would work with the public. Tim is all about more, and more profits. So now you see a very expensive eco system that draws significant revenue from those that are loyal to Apple. Tim wanted to improve the world, Tim has done nothing to improve the world. The whole green slant of Apple products is a cloak screen magic act. Their design of Apple products have built in lifespan and anti-repairability."
MKBHD internally calling out the bs when Tim clueless of what to say spewed out that ergonomics is what checks out on the flat magic mouse.
"Video is kind of a stinker compared to your normal videos.  A bunch of softball, non-relevant questions, and corporate speak.  Disappointed that you didn&#39;t ask difficult questions about Apple shortcomings that you have previously identified."
"Dr. Brownlee, you’re an inspiration to many Black kids all over the world. Wishing you even greater success in all your endeavors. Take care and God bless."
Tim said don’t compare him to LeBum
Speaking for 16 minutes without saying anything at all whatsoever. This guy should be a politician or a secret agent.
You know Tim doesn&#39;t use a magic mouse when he mentions the ergonomics
What&#39;s next? Talking tech with God and the Holy Spirit?
So I guess he did not get the game lol
What a wholesome guy
He got Tim with the magic mouse...<br><br>&quot;eRGoNoMicS wAs kEy&quot; he said<br><br>Marquess with the weird look<br><br>Perfection 👌<br>/chef&#39;s kiss
Be brave.....wear a Samsung watch
"Like before watching. Man, this is sick! What’s next?"
"After the Magic Mouse segment, I hope this initiates Apple to make a better mouse. Hopefully, something that competes with MX Master"
"It was very interesting to hear Tim Cook talking off script and openly, great interview."
"Loved the question about the magic mouse. Man, Tim Cook could not talk crap on it even though that mouse is just terrible in terms of ergonomics."
Such an incredible shame that you’ll never be invited back to an Apple event again
the part about legacy was quite stupid. thats not really the way you talk about it with an active CEO sitting in front of you.
The way he dodged the rankings he could run for president after being CEO
Very interesting here
“Our objective was never to be first but to be best” <br><br>Damn straight
You might as well work for Apple PR and you’re only doing their propaganda.
Great interview.  I would be interested in a ‘day in the life’ style video following Tim Cook with the focus being how he incorporates the different apple products into his everyday life (work and leisure).
This comment section is the reason why apple keeps their comments disabled 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=883"">14:43</a> windows and not tiles? <br>🤣"
Set him up with that Vision Pro question 🤣
I guess Marques intentionally took the iPhone when he was interviewed. He actually took the pictures of WWDC with S24ultra when he posted them on the X. Good shot.
Why does Tim look like the most depressed but still entitled lesbian you would see walking down a random avenue in LA
that thing with Tim&#39;s parrots hit me very emotional
"Interesting that the iPod didn&#39;t make the list at all, considering the monumental impact that device had on both the entertainment industry and Apple as a company.  The iPhone doesn&#39;t exist without the iPod."
imo tim isnt the right guy to talk about AI with apple. to me it seems he has real difficulties to grasp it.
"His response about the potential for nefarious uses of gen-AI was so demoralizing. Unfortunately, this &quot;we&#39;ll wait and see and deal with it later&quot; attitude is shared across the board of all tech titans. It&#39;s a gold rush and they see dollar signs. When bad things happen they will apologize and promise to do better, but the responsibility for unleashing this damage will be theirs."
Marques is the goat
Ese Marcas!
tim cook is great but he copy pasted his responses from ijustine’s interview
Really nice to see MKBHD give attention to these small businesses !!
"Tim talking about looking at photos of his parents in 3D made me feel something.<br>I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get that depth detection and processing for regular phones as well. Using the gyroscope to display pseudo embedded holograms (Like games do).... But I remember the difference in playing a game on a screen vs wearing a VR headset. There is a feeling of presence, which I&#39;m sure is powerful when looking at photos or videos of lost family and friends."
Tim isn’t very good at interviews apparently. They should have picked Craig.
People were calling the Ipod IpAd before iPad came out and iPod  dissapeared soon after. I&#39;ve personally always wanted iPod touch with a sim for at least data that&#39;s all
This was the most HR ass interview known to man. <br><br>Marques- &quot;How old are you Tim?&quot;<br>Tim- &quot;That&#39;s a good question. Apple wants to be the best!&quot;<br>Me- &quot;Bro do it again... do it one more f***in time...&quot;
"the magic mouse allows for hand gestures right? that&#39;s what&#39;s cool about it. the charging on the bottom, not so much"
Tim must have been excited to meet with MKBHD
Props to Márquese for keeping a somewhat straight face when asking about the Magic Mouse.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a>... even the Magic Mouse was an incredible moment - -im sorry, Tim Cook ruined his credibility with this interview. He had to play the blind ranking game properly. Not give these politician answers"
Corpo speak partially internalized 🤔
Cant live with out my iPad &quot;Cap&quot;!!!!
How I RAN to the comments at Magic Mouse and Marques’ face. 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=745"">12:25</a> HAHAHAHAHA LOOK AT HIS FACE WHEN TIM SAID THAT🤣🤣🤣"
Tim clearly forgot what the Magic Mouse was.
"Their choice to delay was wise, given all the issues generative products have had. Associating it with privacy and guardrails was a smart move. Methodologically, they don&#39;t want AI to be special. They want it to be integral and spread across their ecosystem. Each addition may not be particularly transformative, rather, people want useful AI-derived features that are easy to use and understand."
All Apple products are memorable ones according to Tim. Love all my kids the same.
Apple is all about preaching user-customizability without actually being customizable.
No questions relating to the location of the magic mouse charging port?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=742"">12:22</a> shows he doesn’t think about the Magic Mouse nearly as much as anyone who uses it"
the ergonomics😅
Marques: the Magic Mouse?<br>Tim: ehhh mmmm…well getting the ergonomics right<br>Marques: 👀 …. The Magic Mouse.... 👀<br>😂🤣
"always facinating to pay close attention to how people in positions like his talk. you can see the gears turning in his head making sure each word reveals exactly how much he wants to. these people are aliens. always important to note what they dont say, it&#39;s more telling than what they do."
The Magic Mouse had the ergonomics of a door stop
Tim Cooked
"The camera work during the “Magic mouse” segment, sure was edited differently 😅"
"Let tim cook, i said let tim cook!!"
A.I. Apple Indigestion
Missed opportunity to tell Tim about iPadOS
He said he wouldn&#39;t pick favorites and he didn&#39;t
"tim cook is one of the most evil looking dudes ever, bro looking like a bond villain."
Ergonomics 💀
You ask really great questions Marques. It’s absolutely hilarious/interesting to watch Tim not answer them. Lol And dance around giving the actual answer to the question you asked instead of his preprogrammed answer. He’s so slippery and nebulous with his answers.
He tap danced around ranking them lol
what nikes are those on tims feet?
If you made shirts that just said &#39;ERGONOMICS&#39; with the outline of the mouse below it - I and everyone who likes this comment would cop
Considering Microsoft has put copilot on devices even if you opt-out I was pleased to hear Tim’s comments of the end user having to agree to go to open AI!
I like how you asked him to rank products and he completely ignored it 😂
Last part of the vid: i have never seen Tim Cook so in trouble
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> How did he not laugh"
"Tim talking about his late parents in the end was shockingly insightful to see him so introspective and vulnerable, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen that before"
saying privacy just one too many times for a company offering backdoors to the gov
aint no way bro said the apple mouse was ergonomic
Tim has got the signature custom nikes on. Bros is cooking
"Don’t care how big MKBHD is now, it’s still dope as hell seeing him just get all these exclusive interviews"
Why not asking if older devices will get AI features
Marques&#39; face when Tim calls the magic mouse ergonomic was everything I needed. Sell a shirt with your face and that quote and I might literally have to buy that shirt.<br><br>Long long time listener/watcher first time commenter. But I needed to because MKBHD KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH THAT GAME 💀💀💀
Magic mouse very ergonomic 😅
"Great interview Marques - your poise, manner, and comfort in interviews has vastly improved over the years. Great work!"
"Great job, Marques, as always. <br><br>Tim…Tim, Tim, Tim. Oy. Could your answers have been any more dull 😂 You realize the average person going out of their way to watch an interview with a tech CEO isn’t that dense, yes? We don’t want boring corporate drivel; we want honest, candid responses that actually tell us something we didn’t already know."
Is that new atoms MKBHD lows 👀
You know what to do Marques 🫡
That Magic Mouse section is a classic 😂😂😂
The audio sounds really good!
"Here at 403,817 views."
"Don’t know why people don’t think the Magic Mouse isn’t ergonomic. I’ve used many mouse’s and for the Apple ecosystem it’s the best mouse out there. I love it. If you’re gaming ofc it’s absolutely awful, but for editing and general use it’s the best. For me anyway."
Hey it’s Tom Apple!
TimKBHD
Introducing the magic mouse pro. The components will be sold seperately. That&#39;s magic🔥
Love Tim Apple ❤
Ai isn&#39;t impressive lol I love how these executives talk like it is 😂😂😂
Marques did him dirty with the magic mouse and he laughed a little on the Ergonomics thing 😂. MKBHD what a legend 🤣🤣👍🏻
We should have used AI to summarize this.
Tim Cook is my idol. and it is a point of reference in my life. I hope he stays at Apple as long as possible.
This sounded like one big AD every time Tim Apple opened his mouth.
Marques interviewed Apple’s CEO on the day of their big event… Mainstream media is officially ☠️
"Well, agree to disagree; Magic Mouse is great, and ergonomics is defined as how well something adapts to your manners. I use the magic mice without thinking about it."
most important - a <i>special calculator</i> for the iPad is coming
"Great interview on Marques’s part, but I don’t think TC is the man to get anyone excited about Apple’s ambitions for AI. His pitch was basically that AI has been a bedrock of Apple products for years, with an example being an emergency feature that most people are probably unaware of and are certainly not basing their buying decision on, and then he sidelined into a load of drivel about privacy and how Apple is ahead of the legislative curve, which is all well and good but it’s hardly going to get anyone’s juices flowing. Maybe Apple needs someone more visionary at the top? TC has been a safe pair of hands but Apple are languishing in a position of incremental performance improvements and that’s it; they are going to get left behind if they don’t start taking generative AI seriously. I can’t believe Apple have let Microsoft get so far ahead of them on this."
"Man, You made it!! Proud of you and on a personal not... how does it felt sitting there with Tim?"
Love it 😂❤many ways
"Paused the video right before watching it and learned from the comments that they will be talking about a magic mouse, among other stuff."
"Thumbs down for Tim Apple!  He&#39;s terrible, and has ruined Apple. Sure Apple does well for their investors, but their products, innovation, quality, and service have ALL taken a nosedive under his lead."
so thankful Marques took the time to interview a smaller creator like Tim Apple
Tim Apple seems a very sincere person.
"benefit to the user would be schematics, parts and true right to repair."
"Is Apple intelligence really full integrated in their OS? ( that was the question I formulated to Chat GPT <br>A: Yes, Apple’s operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, feature deeply integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. These integrations enhance functionality, improve user experiences, and provide personalized and intelligent features across Apple devices. Here are some key examples of AI and ML integration:<br><br>iOS and iPadOS<br><br>	1.	Siri: The voice assistant uses natural language processing and AI to understand and respond to user queries, perform tasks, and provide recommendations.<br>	2.	Photos App: AI and ML enable features like facial recognition, scene detection, and object identification, allowing users to search and organize their photo libraries efficiently.<br>	3.	Keyboard: The QuickType keyboard utilizes AI for predictive text and autocorrect, making typing faster and more accurate.<br>	4.	Suggestions and Shortcuts: AI provides proactive suggestions and personalized shortcuts based on user habits and routines, helping streamline daily tasks.<br>	5.	Face ID and Touch ID: These security features use advanced ML models for secure facial and fingerprint recognition.<br>	6.	Health App: AI analyzes health data to provide insights and trends, such as sleep analysis and activity tracking.<br><br>macOS<br><br>	1.	Siri: Provides voice-activated assistance similar to its functionality on iOS devices.<br>	2.	Photos App: Like on iOS, AI-powered facial recognition and object identification are used for photo organization and search.<br>	3.	Spotlight Search: Utilizes AI to deliver more relevant search results based on user behavior and preferences.<br>	4.	Mail App: Uses ML to filter out spam and categorize emails intelligently.<br><br>watchOS<br><br>	1.	Activity and Workout Apps: AI and ML analyze movement data to provide personalized fitness and health recommendations.<br>	2.	Health Monitoring: Features like ECG and blood oxygen monitoring use AI to analyze health metrics and alert users to potential issues.<br><br>tvOS<br><br>	1.	Content Recommendations: AI analyzes viewing habits to provide personalized content suggestions.<br>	2.	Siri: Voice search and control capabilities are powered by AI for seamless user interaction.<br><br>HomePod and HomeKit<br><br>	1.	Siri: Voice assistant capabilities extend to smart home devices, allowing for intelligent control of home automation.<br>	2.	HomeKit Secure Video: Uses AI to recognize people, animals, and vehicles in security camera footage.<br><br>Core ML and Developer Tools<br><br>Apple provides developers with Core ML, a framework that allows the integration of machine learning models into apps. This enables third-party apps to leverage on-device AI for enhanced features and performance while maintaining user privacy.<br><br>Overall, Apple’s integration of AI and ML into their operating systems is extensive, aiming to create more intuitive, efficient, and personalized experiences for users across their ecosystem."
"He is a living legend! If u are not aware, u should really look into his career and contributions, ppl think he is dumb or sth because he doesn’t  make apple about him, he is very clear, precise and productive and a very good person in general"
I think it was a wasted chance to ask real questions like “wtf AI will only be on the 15 pro models if the 14 pros are literally the same?”💀
"What a privilege for you, being able it&#39;s interview one of the greatest ceo&#39;s on this planet and having such a relaxed conversation. Thank you for the great interview, please do more."
Bro switched from Samsung S24 Ultra to iPhone for just this interview 🤣
"apple ai is boring, its just normal ai, its just not interesting"
Poor Tim Cook don&#39;t understand the game lol
"Well what I love about the Magic Mouse is, that basically more than 50% of the top surface serves as a trackpad, which is amazing"
Why can’t you ask questions like why did it take so long to be able to move icons anywhere and stuff like that.
the socks from tim are craazy
i summarize the whole video for you<br><br>Marques: why hop now on Ai field TIM?<br>Tim: Money<br><br>ok see you
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=883"">14:43</a> Tim says windows, not tiles, not app space, not any other weird word )))"
"Let me tell all, nothing is private or safe these days, not even end to end encryption."
"I found this interview far too tame and occasionally rather starry-eyed. I expected MKBHD to ask Tim some hard questions about the road that Apple is taking that directly impacts us consumers. Instead, this was more playing to the gallery than being objectively critical. A great moment lost!"
"&quot;Our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be best&quot; Such an apple thing to say, I love Tim."
Good on M challenging Tim with follow-ups regarding his answers and not just accepting nice words. Good on you
My god Tim is so easy to troll. Why can&#39;t he just be chill and honest that not everything is AMAZING
Tim should have said &quot;Peace&quot;
I couldn&#39;t stand Tim&#39;s internal storm on the magic mouse 🤣🤣🤣
Magic mouse🤡
Our model is not the one that needs engagement to succeed  😂<br>Mkbhd🙄
The answers this guy gives every time are the same answers any person not even working at Apple could give. Feels like listening to politicians passive voice answers.
Tim Apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> <br>the magic mouse is absolute garbonzo."
&quot;We didn&#39;t get a blind ranking but we got a good retrospective&quot; lol
Why AI only in 15 pro ???<br>Uhhhh we are not selling phones
And no questions about the Congo. 😔
"MK, professional, polite, subtile enough to bring out the spin, and a few cases of complete hypocrisy if viewers are aware enough.  <br>So very clear why Tim is still the CEO.  One could suggest in ways drinking the same coolade, but probably just a great Marketing Sales bro."
Let tim cook
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> mkbhd tryna keep a straight face while he talks BS about apples worst designed product."
"for some reason he is cooking cheaper things more expensive<br>You know, Timcook absolutely cooking money using their workers and he hides stuffs like...<br><br>Me: That&#39;s how a 21st century business&#39;ss like <br>         (be greedier , the better the profit)"
"people keep saying that Mark Zuckerberg looks like a robot, but nobody talks about Tim Cook&#39;s cadence. Marques, did you poke him to check if his body temperature was that of a human?"
Mkbhd - lets play a game where you rank apple products!<br><br>Tim - yeah no.
It looks like a robot without feelings.<br><br>What a waste of time!
For the next time: ask what phone Tim Cook would use if he can&#39;t choose an iPhone
“The Magic Mouse” question was hilarious 😭
I&#39;m sure all of the questions were vetted before hand...  I do wish there were some harder questions about iPadOS and its limitations.
"Gotta learn from Tim, legacy is what other people look at you."
"He is lying so much even he cant believe it.... He is a corporation himself, screaming corpo, profit, give the least for the most profit.. i believe that steve jobs was the same but this man is just screaming no human just profit and nothing else matters"
Just earlier today I was listening to the same sample used for the intro / outro.  Logic used it for “Clone Wars III” 🙌🏾.  Great song. <br><br>Great interview too.  Really enjoyed.  Thank you.
Tim Gay
"Tim mentioning the &quot;ergonomics&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> and the closeup to Marques&#39; face might just be one of the greatest moments in tech interviewing history😆😆😆😆"
&quot;Ergonomics&quot;
Marques when next you meet him ask when we seeing split screen multitasking on iPhones ❤🙏🏾
Tim seemed nervous talking to MKBHD 😂
I swear nothing was really said during this 16 minutes lmao
I think Steve Jobs is probably the only ever to have all of his dreams literally come true
apple needs to save the world and create a 16 inch ipad with macos and ipados in the same product
"thank you tim apple, very cool"
Haven’t charged my Magic Mouse in 3 months…
"Solid questions, you can see Tim had to actually think about the answers instead of spewing the usual corporate jargon"
"Tim Cook earned roughly $12,000 during this interview."
Can you tell Tim to have the notifications on my watch auto disappear from the screen after a set time limit. That way you don’t have to press anything or gesture on the new watches.
The Magic Mouse was just put into this video as spice 😂😂😂 very aggressive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> 🤭 Marques"
"Hey marq, would you like to try the vivo x100 pro camera? I think it&#39;s interesting to compare to the apple 15 pro"
Why didnt you ask him about default mail app being broken in 2024
"Just out of curiosity, has there been clarification on how the generative image engines are being trained, especially when talking about art and AI."
the disrespectful zoom.
"wow, Tim Apple and Markass Brownlee, together at last"
they did him dirty
Lol I can do all those things on Android
Let him cook 💀
Let&#39;s admit that MKBhD is an iconic brand in tech youtube ✌️
Next please let it be the CEO of Nothing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=433"">7:13</a> - You can see Marques saying &quot;bull crap&quot; to himself by his eyes"
They let him cook
crazy
"The Magic Mouse part was HIGH-LARIOUS!!! &quot;Uhh...the...ergonomics!&quot; Really? I love MKBHD&#39;s look when he gave his answer. Like, Really??? Hahahahahahahaha"
THE CLOSE UPS and ZOOM INS when Marques says Magic mouse and Tim saying &quot;eRgOnOmIcS&quot; is the highlight of WWDC24
Magic mouse.... look at the expression Tim has n Marques has.....uncanny.....Very nice curve ball to Tim by MKBHD.... 😍
Bro even wearing nike glasses 😂😂
The way mk saw the guy when he was talking about &quot;Ergonomics&quot;
He contradicted himself by saying he doesnt look in the past and only looks forward but yet he&#39;s talking about using the vision pro to view old photos of his parents 🤔
Marques brought his secondary phone today for some reason. 🤣
Wow... Nice fluff piece. I haven&#39;t seen such bullshit since the good old days when Ginni Rometty was giving speeches about big data 😂
Apple will hold back on giving AI to iphone 14 pro etc. until theyve sold enough and then will open it up to other models...to sell more. (at least that is my hope because I WANT THIS COOL STUFF)
Magic Mouse was a really good hunt 🙂‍↔️
I&#39;d be really amazed if MKBHD asked about the privacy of people outside the USA because if you weren&#39;t living in the USA like me you wouldn&#39;t feel much safer when talking about privacy so I think Apple have to put some priority for people like us as well
His answer about data privacy really read like a cop-out. Is it segregating local controls and external data processing? How much will users be able to do using exclusive local processing? Is it going to be a general setting? On a per-request basis?
Will Vision Pro become more affordable?
I feel like people don&#39;t realize what this integration with ChatGPT means for other search engines. I caught myself using it lately more often than Google and others. This might define the next decade and other company&#39;s futures
Spent the whole 16 minutes trying to figure out how to separate the Ws in a way to have 2 Ws😭😂
"Why do I want to hear Tim Cook trash one of their products so bad? &quot;iPad, that thing sucks! Like, it does everything my iPhone does, but worse. I don&#39;t know what we were thinking.&quot;"
Fix your bottom teeth man! You&#39;re rich!
"I wish someone would ACTUALLY grill this guy about apples complete lack of innovation over the last decade, how they just steal and repackage android features and how - despite being the third largest company in the world - Siri is STILL SO trash that they need to OUTSOURCE to OpenAI to get a decent assistant. <br><br>Apple is overpriced underperforming garbage."
i’d love to see marques or another tech tuber do a walk through of the apple silicon server farm.
probably most organic interview of Tim Cook
Tim really got that Corpo speech down 👍
"Ah yes, a big corporation speaking about privacy, like they don&#39;t give all the info to Feds."
How about asking real questions instead of making fan service
Split screen next
"I love the moment at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> when Marques and Tim had a moment where they weren&#39;t sure which iPhone MKBHD was using :) <br>Definitely seems like there might be a few 16&#39;s out in the world that are getting reviewed at the moment. Didn&#39;t expect review units would be out and about in June but I also can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised."
in marques we trust
Marques is actually the goat
wow Tim has lost the plot
Your poker face omg
Maybe their AI can tell them to stop making phones with a huge cutout on the screen if it is so &quot;intelligent&quot;.    Maybe it can tell them how to stop having flat revenue for year after year despite not even adjusting it for inflation (which would shave off another 10%).
RIP Tim’s parents.
Im waiting for marques to be like this whole conversation was AI generated
The Magic Mouse segment was hilarious!! LMAO
Could have been more exciting with the more in depth questions about the apple strategy..
It’s 3:30pm and this guy already has 11 hours of standing. Must’ve been up all night… 😅
I have a REGULAR QUESTION!! No SHITSTORM FOR QUESTIONS!!<br>In the Keynote and now in the Interview I see these Rainbow Colors.. Now Tim Cook wears rainbow Socks... So are these the old Macintosh Colors or is this a hidden sign to celebrate Pride Month? I am just curious! Tell me please!
16 gb of windows is 8 gb on mac<br>ur doing it all wrong
This interview was quite &quot;empty&quot;. 😢
"Windows was mentioned, not tiles...😊"
Why did they give that close up on your face when you listened to his response on the Magic Mouse? 💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=882"">14:42</a> he said it"
"The Magic Mouse: amazing scrolling, amazing gestures, “why” charging and poor ergonomics<br>Tim just noting a products strong points: eRgOnOmiCs"
You should have asked him about Right to Repair
Lowkey wished Marques used Samsung s24 ultra in the interview. Also i like how he showed respect.
"I’m old, really old. I don’t get where some(most) of you commenters have to be so negative. It’s ok to critique, but this constant stream of snarky tweets provides little information that’s useful. <br><br>Yeah, guess I’m pinning on decades ago where there was some small level of  courteously or at a minimum, respect. But hey, it’s your generation, mine worked on stopping a foreign war, improving civil and women rights, went to the moon and created iPods, iPhones, etc.  But that’s so old school /s."
"“Ohhhh, I love the Vision Pro, I used it last night for the first time in months”"
Meeting With Marques Brownlee is going to boost that Tim guy&#39;s career significantly.
"Congrats mkbhd, you are bigger than apple ! Make them take the lead again!"
Tim Cook mentioned Windows. Huge.
He has basically completed all the side quests now 😂😂
"This has got to be some of Tim’s toughest moments being interviewed, several sensitive topics had to be carefully carried out and answered with some degree of honesty."
Missed the opportunity to ask him about part pairing on apple devices that stops 3rd party repairs
The “How so?” question was sharp 🔪
Why Tim sounds like he is being confronted in a criminal investigation 🤔
"The question about the hope that people spending less time on phone because of the AI?! Come on, people spend time on the phone not to solve important task but on social for bullshit😂👌🏻…"
NO WAY
😮😮😮😮
Ergonomics of the Magic Mouse??? Huh 😂😂
Magic Mouse question was necessary and sarcastic he came out of it with some guts. Gonna tell you that.
The sexual tension is so intense between these two
Wonder what his response would have been to iCloud retaining photos that have been “deleted” as he preaches privacy so much.
"The questions wasn&#39;t bundled with bowtie on top, I liked it very much, thank you"
Why does he sound very nervous?
Tim: “We don’t like looking to the past at Apple” <br>Marques: “Now let’s talk about 5 products from Apple history”
Bro just ignored the ranking?
Why is casting over AirPlay disabled on this video? Beyond annoying.
I feel Tim’s answers are irrelevant
I see Tim&#39;s taking off now. He got to talk with MKBHD
What is MKBHD???
I think you need to get an interview with Jensen Huang or Dr. Lisa Su.
"&quot;/mumble-mumble/ OPPORTUNITY! /mumble-mumble/ POTENTIAL!&quot;<br>Where&#39;s the vision, Tim?<br>Should have stayed in logistics department"
Apple need AI to invent calculator for ipad 😂😂😂
I still don&#39;t understand how the apple cloud thing is different than other clouds in terms of privacy or how exactly its more private
He is firing Tim Cook even he is been careful with his word and those long pause are sus
we got marques in a conversation with small creators like tim cook before gta 6
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=399"">6:39</a> he’s right it was a blimp on the radar.<br><br>And why did people even get excited about these things? Let’s think about it for a second…. How many people use the camera to take a photo or a video? <br><br>How many people use a standalone MP3 player to play music?<br><br> How many people use a standalone calculator, etc. <br><br>We are so comfortable with using our phones, why would we need a standalone AI device on our person? <br>I think these gadgets could do good under certain situations. I think they’re going to do great for security, you could have an AI camera that’s familiar with the people in the house, so it won’t say you’re being recorded or anything. <br><br>But for people that it doesn’t recognize it or give that verbal prompt and etc. But just as a standalone advice is the dumbest thing ever, and like he said, our phones are pretty awesome."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=697"">11:37</a> &quot;our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be BEST.&quot; <br><br><br>a really underrated moment here. love or hate Apple, they always take their time. customers notice! and their wallets prove this 🔥💪"
"This was a great interview, I like how Tim got visibly uncomfortable at the Magic Mouse and began to stammer trying to figure out if he was being punk’d or not."
"Great interview and, I learn a lot ...👍"
Tim seems more nervous than King MKBHD. Imagine that.
MKBHD is the G.O.A.T
Tim cook getting cooked with that magic mouse question 😂
Ergonomics with magic mouse 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"People about the Magic Mouse, but not focusing on the important question about privacy and AI👌🏻…"
Tim got cooked
Tim is a liar 😂😂 he doesn&#39;t know anything about AI
The way he is looking at Tim in Thumbnail😀
"I find this dude fascinating, I could listen to him all day!   <br><br><br>Tim’s cool too."
Over complicated answers
Look on Marcus&#39;s face when TIM said Magic Mouse had Best Ergonomics 😂😂😂😂
"Wait, they got the ergonomics well done on the Magic Mouse? 😂"
Great Interview. Poor Tim 😂
dude doesn’t know what AI is
"With the Magic Mouse, 😂😂😂😂😂<br>That Editor needs a raise for showing us Marques Reaction."
should have asked about their training data... all privacy but probably used non consensual data collection
"Our model does not require (substantial, increasing, constant) engagement to succeed. This is such a powerful statement and contrasts so brightly against the likes of META and Google."
"Interesing idea to present a blind ranking! My choices would have been the apple pencil, homepod, airpods, apple tv, and vision pro. Wish he would&#39;ve ranked them!"
a nice conversation between dark and light mode<br>😋
"The magic mouse? Tim was struggling. Ngl it&#39;s not as horrible as its made out to be, but it DEFINITELY isn&#39;t good"
marques shill lee
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> i don&#39;t even need to say anything lol, the timestamp itself will be a meme for a long long time. This and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> would be great meme templates 😂"
"Never doubted it, but this proves that MKBHD has serious clout. MKBHD and staff, don&#39;t shy away criticizing Apple&#39;s product releases (more than ever today), yet still secure the huge Apple interviews. Good Job!"
Marques chewed down his LOL moment when Tim Apple mentioned the magic mouse and the word &quot;ergonomics&quot; in the same sentence😁
"I’m dying laughing to Tim’s serious answers to some of the intentionally framed questions, I guess he had to keep the company image alive 😂"
This video might become the one which will help MKBHD surpass Apples’s YouTube subscribers. What an irony 🤌🏾
My dude could just say &quot;I won&#39;t rank them but I express my feelings about them&quot;. WTF was these answers? &quot;Also Incredible moment&quot;
"I wanted them to talk more about Apple&#39;s AI features and their compatibility with iPhones other than15pro.<br>I literally just got the iPhone 15 over the iPhone 15 pro just cause i thought i won&#39;t be needing the &quot;pro&quot; features but after the WWDC,<br>kinda bummed to know that my latest iPhone won&#39;t be getting the AI features.....<br>Really very disappointing😑"
Tim “Cooked”
"Tim cook on any questions on AI is like privacy, crash detection, fall detection lol🤣🤣"
"Man, you really had to bring out the &quot;other phone&quot; in front of Tim and make history 🤣🤣"
"Aw maaan it would be so hilarious if you took the S24 Ultra to the interview <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> <br>like you did in the summary vid :D"
"The time is now that people are getting tired of major Corp CEOs being this bland. Ugh, it’s hard to even listen to. Marques, you did great as usual. But it’s not lost on anyone that there was a clear difference between you two, main being, Tim doesn’t “live” in the real world like the rest of us. He seems so detached…..he speaks much like our politicians…. Old and out of touch."
വാപ്പച്ചിടെ Legacy
If you think about it. In every interview he has had with the YouTubers he has used it to talk about and market what they just announced on stage. It’s the same talking points
make a video on &quot;sony xperia 1 vi&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> the look on his face"
tim aple
"This is exactly what I’ve been telling people. Chatbots are not the definition of Ai, ai is the best when we don’t notice it in its action."
Love the socks
"Holy crap, MKBHD has come FAR!!! Interviews with Google CEO and now Apple CEO<br>🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯"
"Eh, I feel like Tim is talking like the inside of an EU LA agreement."
Of course he’s closed all his rings
that zoom was personal 💀🤣
"Who is paying who with this kind of interviews? It&#39;s definitely well-paced, structured and scripted, in a sense that both Marques and Tim know the questions and gist of the answers."
MKBHD more like MKADHD interviewing Tim.
Tim is totally not a product guy.. he doesnt evoke any excitement on the products he talks about.
great
"MKBHD&#39;s face when Tim mentioned &quot;Ergonomics&quot; 😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a>"
this is pure corporate wash
Surprised to hear that Tim personally reviews some of the apps for the vision pro.
The camera lingering on MKBHD’s face when Tim mentions the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 😂
The fact that apple&#39;s CEO thinks that the magic mouse is &#39;Ergonomic&#39; is mind boggling
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> I died laughing as the camera zooms into his face because you know he&#39;s trolling hard with the magic mouse"
"Marques had to pull up with an iphone.Soon as no one&#39;s watching, the s24 ultra is out.😂"
"Their vision for AI seems TOO MUCH and TOO INVASIVE.... Like the phones will start controlling you instead of you controlling your phone.<br>Hopefully, there will be a way to disable the ability to use it!"
"I do think Apple needs a new CEO sooner rather than later... Tim is great, but I think it&#39;s time for him to let go."
apple fanboy lol
My homie MKBHD has gotten so big Tim Cook got the opportunity to talk to him ngl im crying from proudness
The look on MKBHDs face when Cook talked about the “magic mouse”.     … 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> bros himself confused what model it is <br><br>as designed ig ? or so lazy that they made everything same that he himself can&#39;t distinguish their own products"
Tim Cook tryna lift the phone up to check if it&#39;s the iPhone 15 and not the older model 😂
Why didn&#39;t you ask him why ripping 10 year old Android features is being portrayed as innovation?
Funny how MKBHD did the AI review using his galaxy S24 for notes but shows up at the interview with Tim with a pristine iPhone 15 😂
"For something that wasn&#39;t prepared, Tim gave solid responses imo!"
Seems to be a serial entrepreneur that Tim Cook and Apple thing... I&#39;ll check their homepage!
Marques was clever about with the Magic Mouse
Apple will use Trust me bro technology to guarantee privacy on the cloud
Never seen YouTube commenters psychoanalyze a chief executive the way they do for Tim. Just goes to show the envy around Apple constantly proving everyone wrong. Very nice to see.
Should have asked why Siri didn’t get a huge improvement considering the whole AI kick
the magic mouse lmao Marquess was definitely like thats BS
"Wie aufmerksam das MKBHD, Apple die Bühne gibt seine Reichweite zu nutzen und zusammenzusitzen. Scheint eine größere Nummer zu sein dieser Tim Cook... ;)"
"Does he understand OpenAI? I mean, what does he mean by we use the same Silicon on the device to generate content and store it on the same cloud? Does he mean, they have forked Open AI to make decisions and have that saved to through an APP? This means the information will not be relevant after a while since it isn&#39;t updating. Or I&#39;m getting something terribly wrong here?"
"Almost an announcement, not an interview. Did they force you to bring your iPhone with you?"
Now someone needs to interview Marques and ask him how he managed to keep it together in the Magic Mouse section lol
MKBHD cooked with this video
"Hey, I am Marques. I am asking Tim Cook for about 2 weeks."
Kudos on putting Magic Mouse and ergonomics in the same sentence
Would have been fun to watch if Marques carried a Galaxy or Pixel to this interview
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> lulz"
"What is the point of this talking without saying anything? Cook should listen to Marques, not the other way."
Tim Cook does not know what the fuck he is talking about. It&#39;s so evident in this that he has hardly any technical knowledge.
I see marques holding his laugh back when tim was saying ergonomics and the magic mousse in the same sentence 😂😂😂
For 1/3 of the video (ranking) you let him talk about apple products while you could have asked him questions.
Even tim needs to look back the device to know its 13or 14or 15
"Privacy, apple doesnt make much sense"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> did he just have trouble identifying what model it is? * gasp *"
Then a tech Journalist is born 🎉
I really hoped that Marquess was going to ask what he thought about the Ipod shuffle
anyone else notice how nervous Tim was 😭
I wonder if Tim Cook gets nervous talking to someone as important to tech as MKBHD.
I like how Marques was able to keep almost straight face when Tim was talking about the Magic Mouse.
Woah......!!
The Zoom in&#39;s was priceless
Great interview Marquis! Really great questions asked well done 😊
Cook never gave his rankings.
Impractical Jokers backstage gotta be laughing hysterically after telling Tim to say the mouse has good ergonomics
Ask Tim if there’s plan for a limited Apple intelligence version for 14 pro and pro max in the future to make it compatible for those devices
The hubris of calling it Apple Intelligence is obnoxious.
Crazy how you can’t get a single answer from that guy
It&#39;s criminal negligence to put ergonomics and magic mouse in a single sentence😂
"Of all the people in the world, I&#39;d love to meet these two. Incredible people."
"Marques you a real one for not laughing when Tim was talking about ergonomics of the magic mouse, you are a true professional!"
"was that a slip up at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=317"">5:17</a> hinting at silicon chips, possibly M series chips coming to iphone?👀"
wouldn&#39;t be that enterview a good opportubity to ask Tim Crook about right to repair?
"You had a chat with Tim and all you could talk about is the pointless AI? <br>The entire AI thing is one big lie. All these AI actually is not even 1% AI. It&#39;s all programs, designed to behave as if it&#39;s AI. It&#39;s not rigid like normal apps, but it still gets told what output to come up with. <br><br>Ask any proper electronics engineer and they will tell you this is all just noise. ZERO AI!<br><br>You wasted a chance. Ask him about foldable iPhones, innit?"
"Great interview! But can&#39;t help myself. Love the segue from &quot;we don&#39;t have museums and look to the past&quot;.... &quot;Ok, let&#39;s play a game where you have to rank historical apple products&quot;"
The zoom in on Marques when Tim said ergonomic…bro had to control himself there😅
Marques got him thee with the Magic Mouse! Also S/O to the camera guy!😂We see what you did there!
"so, nike is sponsoring Tim cook now?"
"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/EvkfY6uNC5OykQOewoCQAQ""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw""></a>"
"There will be time when big companies will understand that dis-honesty is something people see from miles away and it&#39;s not good.. it so obvious Marques acknowledges Tim is bullshiting the entire interview. Everytime Tim is saying sh!t, Marques &quot;interesting&quot;."
Tim should be really lucky to get interviewed by mkbhd
Interesting. You know when you see early hands on of tech and every video sounds exactly the same. Same questions and especially same answers. This is almost a carbon copy of the Tim Cook iJUSTINE interview. <br><br>Apple have got their PR machine down to a tee
I like how he makes sure to pull out a iphone instead of his real daily phone when talking to cook lol
What do you use Vision Pro for? Answer: still figuring out how to sell it! 😂😂
That Marques’s look when Tim said Ergonomics for Magic Mouse says it all.
"Yes, the editor did zoom in to catch Marques chuckle when Tim said ERGOnomics... ROFL... !!!!"
MKBHD asking great questions!
"This is the reason MKBHD cant share his real thoughts feelings about Apple products, otherwise they would stop including him in these things.  Just for this reason the reviews are tainted and not genuine."
"First Marques video: he pulled out an S24. In this one, his iPhone 👌. Imagine Marques pulling out the S24 in this interview, that&#39;d been awesome 😎"
"100,000 subs to beat apple"
Bro speaks in customer service
I thought he was gonna say last one apple cloth.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=127"">2:07</a> In da beninining"
No way did tim cook say the ergonomics of magic mouse is key.. cos it isnt. And dont start on the charging port……. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Imagine this was 12 years ago and marques was famous enough to talk to Steve.
"In your WWDC video you were reading your note from your galaxy phone. In your convo with Tim, you’re conveniently reading your notes from an iPhone….. well played sleight of hand my friend. Well played."
"This interview is very interesting, especially from the details of the blind ranking, I can feel the little offense and defense between the two sides."
Tim cook has to be the worst person to interview
&quot;The magic mouse... yea that was also... a thing... blabla ergonomics&quot; I have a pretty good feeling where he would put it on his list.
Marques is the kinda guy who&#39;ll wear formal suit for his own smartphone awards video but wear a normal shirt jeans with Tim Cook. Ultimate flex and dopeness!!
Tim Apple<br><br>Timothy Macintosh
"he is never giving marquess an interview again, haha"
"great interview, but imagine Marques sitting like this with Steve Jobs."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=203"">3:23</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=249"">4:09</a> is insane lmao. Some politician level whoopdidty doo going on"
"You had me <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">05:27</a> when Tim points towards your phone but wanted to confirm &amp; you said 15!"
Tim Cook is the worst thing that ever happened to apple his always pushing for his gay agenda not improving devices for years with every product has terrible battery that’s the best the richest company can do they are stealing from apple fans for years the worst case was with AirPods Pro with no inovations no real change like everything apple and we can’t forget about iPad terrible for years we got nothing please 🙏 leave quit and take your gay flag with you no one care and then and only then we will see what apple really can do leave timi and also take these fake YouTubers that you are paying with your products with you so they can give you fake praise s that you absolutely don’t deserve leave timi
"Our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be the best. And i applaud for that. Because they refine something that exists and do the unexpected with it. People may always say they copy this and that feature, but the execution of the feature by apple is 10 times better than the original in some cases. I just wished that one day apple and android could join forces and create the best phone of both worlds."
"A lot of hate for the Magic Mouse here, but I use mine for years and love it. Not sure what you all have an issue with tbh"
"Man, you were too slick about that magic mouse😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. I can see the smirk on your face."
Another apple ad…
Interesting to see what man like Tim is Cooking
MKBHD: just 16 min??   tim: pay to upgrade
"Bruh, Magic Mouse &quot;Getting the ergonomics right was very important&quot;, I wish it were more important."
Tim trying to act like apple isnt eating shit with this OpenAI deal
having never actually heard Tim Cook talk I am genuinely impressed at how well Riley over at TechLinked did his impressions of him
U really cooked Tim on that magic mouse !
Now we need talking tech with Zuck!
Tim pivoted on those rankings like a true CEO
"Yeah, Markass won. Interview with Apple&#39;s CEO. That&#39;s the very top of tech journalism"
"I wasn’t expecting Tim Cook to bash the Magic Mouse, but to go as far as to call it ergonomic… Damn."
The most important question: Did you ask him if you should buy your grandma an iPhone?
I can&#39;t watch this video because I cringe very easily and I know this is going to be too much for me to handle.
Let Tim Cook!!!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=331"">5:31</a> tim cook not recognizing the model by looking at the iphone is the epitome of irony"
Marques&#39;s smile after casually dropping the magic mouse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Isn&#39;t this the evil guy from Jurrasic park fallen kingdom?
I bet he have never used the magic mouse
What a cop out…..
Lots of tech reviewer&#39;s talking to Tim Cook. How much is Apple paying for all of this?
Tim Cook has a strange rythm of speaking
Thank you for your time Tim Apple
Marques for President! 🐐
Well that&#39;s one way to say a bunch of nothing by saying a lot
Lew vs apple<br>Marques Collab with apple
Tim Crook doesent know wat hes talkin all he wants to say is just buy apple spend more money.
His generation of CEOs are always so fake and full of PR speak.
So the thumbnail is the magic mouse moment? 😅
Apple doesnt need a museum because there are already people out there tracing and tracking and keeping old apple alive. So why waste energy on that when people are doing it for you. 🤯🤯
Wait did he not rank them at all?!
tim is setting new fashion trends with my childhood socks
"Bro said magic mouse has ergonomics, what ergonomics?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> Bro couldn&#39;t even recognize his own creation! which means a lack of creativity at Apple!"
AI ❌ Machieans Lornung ☑️

I’d like to hear more on how their cloud compute is more secure than OpenAI. Technical breakdown by 3rd party.
What a bunch of bullshit
U do all MKBHD
Wow only 300k views in 2hrs?? This channel really fell off… 🤓❤️‍🔥
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> reminds me the &quot;In the beninging&quot; meme 😂😂😂"
Did you carry S24U all the way to the interview or just for taking id-card photo?
The magic moment was hilarious😂
"The no. 3 BEST product is the Magic Mouse omg I laughed sooo hard. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> The moment the aggression of the interview went from 0 to 100%<br><br>Tim went from being “this interview is great, I hope more people sees it”to “no one sees this interview PLS”"
Apple doesnt need a museum because there are already people out there tracing and tracking and keeping old apple alive. So why waste energy on that when people are doing it for you. 🤯🤯
"MKBHD fell off, 0 views in 0.0001sec."
Make the iPhone exciting again.
Jersey &amp; Apple ❤ it T.O.F.C.
"Hi Marques, I am from Nairobi, Kenya, in Africa. I would like to know when Apple will include some features that can be used and are specific to my country. I look forward to the day Apple releases accessible gadgets worldwide, with features specific to each African country (especially in Kenya). I hope this makes sense to you, but what do you think?"
"I like MKBHD as an interviewer, I could feel you want to let Tim say something to the audience and at the same time you have a very sharp lens to dig and explore the answers in a polite way. You are so wise!❤"
Little laugh when Tim picked up the phone which was an Android and referenced an iPhone 😂
"Based on his response to Magic Mouse, I&#39;m assuming his response to the hockey puck mouse (universally hated) is &quot;game changing&quot;"
"Marques poking just at the right corners and Tim answering slowly and thoughtfully…man, that’s some chess playing right there!"
"Not even Tim Cook believes his words when talking about ergonomics in the magic mouse, insane."
VWDC?
Lol Tim had to check if his phone was a 15 Pro
This guy doesn&#39;t know how a ranking works...
xDDDDD magic rat
Kudos to Tim Cook.
How can you mention Magic Mouse and ergonomics but not question back about the weird charging situation going on. Seems strange!
This is mad. So proud of this guy as a fellow black man ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Im a photographer (support me gooys please I need this)
Mkbhd was holding his laugh about the &quot;ergonomic magic mouse&quot;
The Magic Mouse was the funniest part of the vid 😂
I love how he completely ignored the fact that it was supposed to be a RANKING of those products...
I liked the video.
Tim finally making it big by appearing in your channel lol! Great interview
Great interview!
hemm... you used an iphone today
Love how Tim refused to rank the products. Just another example of awesome business acumen
The Look in the Thumbnail😀
I kept waiting for Marques to side line Tim with a question about Cobalt mining lol
Not sure you will be invited back next year. Bringing up the Magic Mouse and the Vision Pro?! Bit of an underhanded move.
Marques hits it out of the park...again! 🤜
is making up titles the only way you can be number one at anything
Mans dripping in PR sauce
TIM COOK IS A PROFESSIONAL YAPPER OMG
"It’s crazy how well he speaks, without even letting other realize."
"If privacy is a fundamental human right, what&#39;s up with building in China?"
I definitely always liked how apple had always called AI &quot;Machine Learning&quot; instead
He didn’t even rank anything 🙃 he just said everything was a huge moment
It should have been talking with AI Tim Cook
Yeah magic mouse and ergonomics suuuureeee....
"I swear that we are getting a new magic mouse with the next mac announcement. Tim was like wait we sell a mouse, oh fuck that thing, forgot about that…"
How gracious to give Tim the privilege to talk with MKBHD
MKBHD visibly struggling hard when the ergonomics were mentioned while talking magic mouse 😅
The magic mouse 😂
"Dude… you had access to THE MAN… “So, Tim, how long are you going to hamstring iPadOS - or are you just always going to ensure iPads are never going to be able to replace a laptop?” I know… I get it. You took the high road and you have class. But still… would have loved to see him squirm. I bought a Surface Pro and this so-called “toaster and refrigerator combo” absolutely rocks. It’s what iPad could have been."
Marques was fighting that smile when Tim called the Magic Mouse “ergonomic” 😂
Great to see Mark Ass Brownie interview Cook
I wonder how his dead parents would feel about being used as a marketing tool.
Ok mkbhd never getting to talk to apple again ever again!! EVER !!!!!!!!!!
"love the candid vibes from the interview. Tim seemed a bit nervous here, maybe he was starstruck :)"
Gracias Marques!
"The devil works hard, but MKBHD works harder"
MB becomes more and more bought and biased
let him cook
who let Tim Cook with the magic mouse?
"Editor tried his best to piss off Apple, fighting Marques’ poker face."
Amazing 🥳
“Apple has always been focused on privacy” yeah ok dude lol
Is Tim cooking or is Tim getting cooked?
Oh snap you really are the man brother ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
I&#39;m not sure how much Apple controls what questions to ask. I was a little disappointed the iPadOS limitations questions didn&#39;t come up!
Freaking hilarious when Tim Cook realized Marques didn’t have an iPhone.
kinda boring questions :)
"If you can, ask Tim why they don’t care about what logic users or Final Cut users really want."
LET TIM COOK 🔥⌚💻🖥📱
Tim (and most CEOs I&#39;ve seen talks or spoken with) have this magnificent ability of steering the conversation away from the task at hand in a way that baffles me. At risk of maybe getting Linus&#39;d by Apple I really think Marques should be more insistent on getting real answers out of his questions when interviewing people of such positions. You are in this very unique position to be able to do that and the world needs you to get real answers. It does require great care but I definitely think you&#39;ve got it seeing how you reacted to this one.
"man MKBHD has come a long way and I am super proud of him. Imagine having an interview with one of the most powerful people on earth, I know even some presidents would die at the chance to talk to Tim just for 5 minutes  The guy heads a company with revenue bigger than most countries around the world."
"I feel like just a few years ago, Apple execs would never interview YouTubers. How times change!"
"Also re: generative AI that can’t be abused, that’s why with the little image generator thing in iOS 18 it’s limited to cartoon, sketch and animated styles."
You guys are wicked 😂😂... The way you zoomed in on him all through the magic mouse moment. The fact that marques kept a straight face through tim cook talking about ergonomics😅.<br><br>Tim failed miserably on this one.
"Man, to work for Apple… my dreams would become reality!"
This is the collab we wanted but never knew we needed! Love this 🖥️💻
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=952"">15:52</a> .. could feel Tim&#39;s emotions when he choked up remembering his Parents!🙏"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=322"">5:22</a> - did he think you brought an Android phone to the interview?"
So great seeing MKBHD with a fan 😄
“If you are looking at your phone more than you are looking into someone’s eyes”<br><br>*Laughs in 6 hours of screen time.
Talking smack with Tim Cook
"In the beninging <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=127"">2:07</a>"
I’ve been looking for an ergonomic mouse. Time to buy a Magic Mouse!
whoever edited the Magic Mouse bit 👏👏👏<br>also Marques you&#39;re a pro&#39;s pro for keeping it together there 😭
Such an awesome collab
"Got to be honest, up to the blind ranking, this was one of the best executive interviews I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Tim seemed to genuinely want to answer the questions and not just read a script."
ask him to prove the worth of ipad for $1500 ?
"So, is it me or tim cook sounds nervous talking to mkbhd"
"The reason apple has never mentioned ai is because apple is not s t u p I d. Ai can not exist without external stimuli (coders) telling it exactly what to do. Ai can not code itself.. therefore it can never be sentient/intelligent. Even if an &quot;ai&quot; was created with the sole purpose of adding new ram and brand new processors to itself every day, it could not do so without being coded/instructed to do so by human/alien coders.. bruh 😂"
I don’t even like Apple but what a banger vid
"Of all of the products one could talk about, why the F talk about &quot;Magic&quot; mouse?!?!  🤦‍♂"
The intentional cut to Marques&#39;s close up during the magic mouse&#39;s ergonomics was crazyy!
"tim didn&#39;t even attempt to play the game, have some fun and just roll with it guy you stiff grey exec."
ahh tim apple
Tim Cook is getting older and we have listen carefully and follow his train of thoughts like you would with your granny.
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=646"">10:46</a> the Apple RP team got involved to prevent the game from happening. That&#39;s why we have that UGLY audio-cut just when we see Steve Job&#39;s presentation. In other videos, this would be an error, but in a MKBHD video, it is proof that they were unable to eliminate some kind of intervention in the audio. The video got solved by the jump cut with Steve showing the MacBook Air."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">05:29</a> Tim was having trouble identifying Marques&#39;s iPhone. Drawbacks of sticking to the same design for the last few generations. Did Marques try not to laugh at that moment! :D"
you can feel the irony in the pauses when he talked about the magic mouse
I wish someone would have the courage to ask Tim questions like: &quot;What would you say to the artists and writers whose work went into training your generative AI models? Did they have a choice in the matter? How about their job prospects in the future? You&#39;ve always marketed your products towards creative people...do you see embracing gen AI as presenting a contradiction with those values? Don&#39;t you want your users creating something new instead of rehashing the art of the past?&quot;
"that magic mouse close ups, nahh the best clip of life"
"Apple be like : is not AI, is AI"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=142"">2:22</a> mkb literally has to bite his lip not to say something after TC repeats the same talking point re crash/fall detection rather than answer the actual question (why did apple avoid using the term &quot;AI&quot; until recently?)"
Is that Tim Apple?
You could have just interviewed the apple website and got all the same responses.
The play and interchange between ‘Apple Intelligence’ and ‘AI’ was well played I must say !
The 👀 when Tim talked about the Magic Mouse ergonomics 😂😂😂
My man Tim choked on the Magic Mouse question 😂
so Marques took the WWDC picture with the Galaxy S24 Ultra and then for the interview he pulled the iPhone15 . 😅
MKBHD wasn’t interviewing Tim 👀🤣🤣🍎🖱️
You really challenged him with these questions. The part about the Magic Mouse was easily the most interesting because he wasn&#39;t sure how to approach the answer in a way where he wasn&#39;t putting down on the product.
&quot;Apple is notorious for never sending anything to the cloud&quot; is where I lost my last piece of hope you have any integrity.
&quot;uuuh....&quot; - tik cook
Why they zoom in like that for the Magic Mouse segment? 😂😂
How to answer questions while not answering questions
Cute socks haha 😆
The pause after the magic mouse speaks louder than words 😂
Loooool
Pre screened questions?
"🍎 Great insights on AI and tech, thanks Tim Cook! 🤖"
Tim Cook has really made it man. I&#39;ve been following him since the beginning. This is an incredible opportunity for him to talk to MKBHD!
Marques: “Apple’s notorious for never sending anything to the cloud. Everything’s on device…”<br><br>Tim in his mind: “That’s what we want you to think”
Tim got that zesty ahh posture
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=759"">12:39</a> this was pretty funny"
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=433"">7:13</a> “We have never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices”<br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=723"">12:03</a> “I couldn’t live without my iPad today”<br>Which one is it, Tim?"
Let him Cook
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=133"">2:13</a> he&#39;s stumbling"
"I realy don&#39;t know why he defends the magic mouse. Just say yeah not that great, we&#39;ll try doing it better next time. Is it realy that difficult?"
"If the AI is using the cloud for computing, why does only ONE iPhone model (iPhone 15 Pro Max) work with Apple Intelligence??"
Another Logic song!
Surprising to see you’ve used Samsung Galaxy phone for your previous video about WWDC 2024 and an iPhone for your interview with Mr.Tim 😄
HE SOUNDS LIKE MR MACKEY AND I CANNOT UNHEAR IT
I skipped everytime Tim talks
You should&#39;ve asked him about how cobalt mining is achieved
Hol up let Tim Cook
"when I listen to Aplpe&#39;s people I never understand how much is true, how much is marketing, and how much is just internal indoctrination."
You guys are just not holding it correctly 😂
"Wow, being able to see your dead parents standing in front of you in 3D like that -- I hadn&#39;t considered how emotional that tech could be."
Magic Mouse mentions: how many??😂
"MKBHD is also a philanthropist, giving interviews to thise who need it in his spare time."
Let Timcook now let Timcook i said let Timcook 🎶
Great interview. Respect for MKBHD 🙌💯
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> Tim Cook: &quot;Our objective is never to be first. Our objective is to be best.&quot;"
WHy does Tim Cooks answers in the last section feel like AI answers 😬😬
Marques is the best.. Tim is also very good if not one of the best. Great interview.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a> Marques’ face and response when Tim said the word “ergonomics” in the same sentence as “Magic Mouse” was priceless 😂😂"
"Magic Mouse killed me. Don’t get me wrong, I love the way it works, but I hate the ergonomics of it"
"Privacy, uuh privacy uuuhhh privacy"
"apple is just a pr company now, can&#39;t see tim cook actually believing even half of what he said, kinda boring and square responses, which is surprising coming from a company that makes great products but for some reason they try too hard"
I like how he avoids saying &quot;out of the ecosystem&quot; by saying &quot;out of the domain of personal context when explaining the &quot;private cloud compute&quot;
Wow Marques interviewing the CEO of a trillion dollar company.
MKBHD With the &quot;device brand&quot; code switch....i see you bruh... I understand 😂😂😂😂
Tim had one task…
"Perfect interview. Straight forward questions. Expected &quot;don&#39;t damage the brand&quot; answers, but Cook added the personal anecdote that made it special."
Tim was not expecting the “ how so”
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=759"">12:39</a> marques isn&#39;t convinced😂😂😂"
"Oh please 😂, he doesn’t use Vision Pro"
Tim&#39;s watch rings<br> --&gt; he nailed his daily w/o<br>goals
"A little disappointed to be honest. I would think when you become as big and influential as Marques is you would use some of that power in interviews like this. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> a simple &quot;Tim&quot; with a side eye to that ridiculous magic mouse answer would have been great to see."
We should all apologize for making fun of Mark Zuckerberg when he said Vision Pro was no better than Meta&#39;s options. In hindsight he may have actually been right!🤣
I wish you asked about the ipad and what we really want from iPadOS
"Closeup shot on MKBHD for &#39;Magic Mouse&#39; - Ergonomics, Says everything.. 🤣"
"It&#39;s OBVIOUS why this guy has become one of the Biggest APPLE SHEEPS in the last 8 years or so.<br>(And this is coming from one of his OG Subscribers, since 2012)"
Marques asking about all other products just to slip in the Magic Mouse.
let tim cook
He says he&#39;s focus forward and not on rare view mirror. But it seems like he just sees forward and see android infront and copies things from there
"It was good to get insight into how Apple looks at AI, its strong commitment to privacy, and focus on the user experience. Looking forward to how &#39;Apple intelligence&#39; evolves."
"Magic Mouse is great, but no everywhere. I have Logitech MX (both Master and Anywhere) and I really love to use them on PC... but for Mac there is nothing like the Magic Mouse is by far the best choice. And if I&#39;m using a MacBook, then the Magic Trackpad on it is unbeatable."
I miss Steve.
Good ol’ Tim Apple
Magic Mouse. 🤣
"Tim Cook couldn&#39;t down his leg so Marques had to lift his own. but afterall morality hit back, great move"
Should have had your notes on your S24 Ultra man - missed opportunity 😂
"I swear to god this entire interview felt like THIS IS SPINAL TAP to me. What&#39;s the new thing, what&#39;s next? &quot;Apple Intelligence,&quot; and the interviewer has to take it seriously. Louis Rossmann had a lot to say about it, and he&#39;s correct."
Tim is struggling with these questions! So funny!
That pause on the magic mouse question
"This was lame, the whole interview was just soft ball questions mixed with Apple fandom. Even the last segment didn&#39;t even go how it as meant to (Ranking was just nostalgic &quot;oh yea&#39;s&quot;) Marques just got steam rolled by Tim Cook."
Great interview
Marques did Tim good. The slow zoomin on their faces XD XD<br>Absolutely hilarious!!! 😂
I&#39;m here for the magic mouse rant.
"Those were some good questions, but for someone at Tim&#39;s level its easy to dodge them with spewing pretentious nonsense."
Marques thoughts hearing “ergonomics” about the Magic Mouse : “naaaaaaa you’re kidding ??” <br>Thus I love the Magic Mouse
"It&#39;s like interviewing Joe Biden what flavour of ice cream did you eat today? 😂 <br>Seriously very boring 😴 next time come with an Android phone and ask some hard questions. <br>iPad calculator, T9, RSS what happens with green and blue bubbles after RSS is enabled? and why everything took so long we had to get to iOS18 just to move the app on the screen. <br>Pain to watch and a waste of time."
gotta love his socks
"Fair play to Tim C, making himself available to Youtubers like this!"
Tim Cook is actually pretty cool
His answers and reactions to magic mouse and vision pro made ma laugh 😂😂😂
Try Galaxy S24 Ultra next time with Tim :D
More  Ai spyware pc iPhone please
Lmaoo “we didn’t get a blind ranking”….Marques never change
The magic mouse. Hahahaha what a troll job that was. 😂😂😂
Tim is such an Apple fanboy. He’ll agree with everything Apple does😂 Great interview MKBHD
"“Our objective is never to be first, it’s to be best.”"
Great conversation.
"The appropriate response was. Ah the magic mouse, yeah we dropped the ball on that one, do we still have that? Oh we need to get rid of it. Shirley make a note please."
"MKBHD: I am going to mention Magic mouse together with Vision Pro, he won&#39;t see it coming :))"
Hahahahaha this dude thinks that the magic mouse has good ergonomics? Has he never used a different mouse?
Is it just me seeing or does Tim seem to have very bad teeth? (No I am not a dentist)
"iOS 18: Pause button for video recording, system clipboard manager, customizable keyboard, notification of how long before the alarm goes off. Impressed.<br><i>Sarcasm</i>"
I&#39;m done with this channel
Where&#39;s mkbhd&#39;s s24 ultra 🤫
"I lost both of my parents before the vision pro came out, a devastating truth, and yet not with vision os 2 I can still imagine as though I hadn&#39;t..."
"MKBHD you think you’re slick through in Magic Mouse, that’s what this whole thing was about. Getting him to recognize it needs to be redesigned.😂"
tim kinda lame for dodging the blind ranking
"Such a stark difference compared to Mark&#39;s, thanks Marques!"
"Respect to Tim, life must be very hard for him, but he serves 🔥 great man it seems!"
Let&#39;s be honest .. he did not convince me that he actually uses vision pro 😂
"They weren’t thinking about AI, they’ve thrown in the towel because they realised they can’t catch up. So joining forces with the “enemy” is the only way forward."
One of the greatest interviews ever
Who looks more nervous?
Is it just me or is it very difficult to listen to Tim Cook?
Your questions show the research you do for these kind of interviews MKBHD... Like always! Thanks and keep going :)
MKBHD: This is the worst WWDC that I&#39;ve ever attended.<br>TIM: Let&#39;s do an interview interview. 😅
"I realise you can&#39;t ask hard hitting questions with these people or you&#39;ll not get the interview again, but really tech YouTubers should get together and decide how they want to be perceived."
A legacy is what others define not yourself
That camera pan when Tim Cook mentioned ergonomics wit the Magic Mouse😭
Oh now I want that Apple Museum to exist.
First time I heard Tim Say “The iPhone” instead of just “iPhone”
I am not gonna update to iOS 18   Because of the redesigned Apple app 😂😂😂 dude that’s sooooo ugly
"Передай ему что уже 4 год он ничего не сделал, похоже староват стал и ему нужна срочная замена. <br>Если ещё 2 года просрёт, то Apple замкнет круг Тойоты😂 и ему на замену придет Huawei, Xiaomi… <br>А людей он не слышит, делает свою видимость работы, но ему уже конец, старый и мозг не воспринимает настоящее, живое прошлым и своими мнением…"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">05:25</a> Even Apple&#39;s CEO has a hard time telling his phones apart (I love Marques swallowing his laughter lol)"
He sounds so drunk 😂😂😂😂
"I am prepared to be destroyed, but I think Magic Mouse is very good."
"great politician. nothing new, just general  blabla"
"&lt;marques&gt;magic interview, magic mouse. &lt;marques/&gt;"
"Finally, Big tech CEO speaks to the community and their customers. Well done MKBHD."
Damn marques really got the chance to talk the master 🖤 
Magic Mouse:- Incredible 😮🎉
Marques: Lets do a blind ranking🎉<br>Tim: NO (but said it nicely)
I loved that you messed with him just enough to get him rethinking Magic Mouse’s existence lmaoooooo
Absolutely amazing.
"“…fifteen, yeah…”🥲"
never liked Tim. he is just so talented at answering questions and not answering it at the same time.
You should have pressed a little bit when he said something about ergonomics
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=745"">12:25</a> I gonna start practicing to look that way, it’s freaking cold and cool at the same time. MKBHD’s coldest moment I’ve ever seen."
So AI will work offline ??? LOL I doubt
This guy went from making tech videos in his dormroom to interviewing the ceo of the biggest company in the world. Thats absolutely wild to think about ❤. Your a f*cking legend man ❤❤❤
"Even though we, Android guys, like to shit on Apple, I feel this was an interesting interview. From a very good PR prepared CEO to an amazing Tech Savy content creator."
The Magic Mouse was sooooo rough but funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tim uuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cook
Yeah the Magic Mouse is soooo ergonomic 🙄
quick into the comments section for that magic mouse gold
"I like your channel and MKBHD, but you are not the person to interview Apple or Tim Cook himself.  The softball questions of if the seems hard hitting is but a softball that is made up of puffy cottons. <br><br>The question I would ask is, Apple mocked Google for scanning customer email so that Google can give useful information back to the customer...yet Apple is now doing the same thing.  I understand apple is very comfortable in glass boxes."
Can’t believe you got a full interview with Cook! Great job!
"Marques, you probably won&#39;t read this, but, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and your content.<br>You&#39;re truly an icon in this industry and also such an inspiration!<br>Always looking forward to seeing your next take on tech!"
U should have told him to fix the cursor on the iPhone and the calculator app
I hope one day I will invite Tim Cook to my podcast on 2050😊
"Nice - but only nice though. You could have been a bit more investigating what&#39;s down the road with AI at Apple and how the already announced features are working. However, a big honor for you to get him into an interview. Great"
nice 2 greedy people talking 👍
"How did it feel to drop “AI” like 8 times right out the gate in front of Tim Cook? Since as you pointed out, Apple seems to avoid that terminology."
Tim is such a salesman 😅
excellent interview!
Marques repeating the word &#39;interesting&#39; says it all
"Well... the watch was canned ML, a subset of learning and then bottling it up and making a watch!"
Magic Mouse? Ergonomics? What??
Vision Pro is the device I want to buy but cannot afford!
They&#39;re really trying to sell you into the whole privacy thing aren&#39;t they? 🤔
Elon mask banned apple soon..
Damn Tim Cook!
"it&#39;s fine he didnt provide a ranking.... but then he started talking app store and diverse community of developers and economic miracle.... MKBHD doesnt have to press but a good pressing question there wouldve been how much of that economic miracle, and the cut they take from it, of the app store is selling cosmetic skins/junk to .... kids basically"
A little to corporate this time. Especially the magic mouse thing
I was listening to this as an audio only Podcast then I heard the ergonomics of it &quot;in the same sentence as magic mouse&quot; I just had to ALT TAB and God that ZOOM!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Hopefully Apple will FINALLY make a new mouse after this interview lol
Timmy getting old ain’t he
"The dude is hanging out with shooters, happy to watch this in 2024."
"Love the interview, Marques, keep up the good work"
The awkward close ups with magic mouse was hilarious haha
"I like this channel since years now, but am having a feeling of DEI,reparation fowel play lately."
"Very clever, Apple does not want to let Open AI in their Ecosystem. The Fence is called security… As we say in Austria/Germany : Don’t make the buck a gardener"
“Requires world knowledge” except if u ask it about Palestine.. then it’s all about how good Israel is and how much of a victim it is.. or simply refuses to answer..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> even tim couldn&#39;t recognise it&#39;s Iphone 15. Crazy!!😅"
Cook is lying
"That’d be so hilarious if you showed up with a google pixel for reading your notes from, the internet would’ve appreciated the move 😂"
Who else think Tim Cook is an AI from the way he talks? 😂
I could feel his fear of Tim when he was asked the 5 questions.
Marques threw no softball questions. Great job!
The iPhone did indeed change the world... ❤
Marques: and <b>Magic Mouse</b><br>Me: oh no…<br>Tim: Magic Mouse… ergonomic…<br>Me: <b>OH HELL NAH!</b>
"I don’t know why, but I felt this particular interview was not the best of what MKBHD has done so far. It’s maybe just me, but it felt like MKBHD was too cocky and didn’t give Tim the opportunity to open up and elaborate. It has to do with his overall behavior and some of the questions. <br>It’s my reaction, like it or not :)"
Wait this is sick!!!!
Finally doing an interview with the Lucifer himself? Impresive.
A very good interview!
MY EPITAPH<br><br>                                                                                                                                                      I was born <br>                                                                                                                                     I gave my money to Tim Cook<br>                                                                                                                                                       I died
"You should have also asked what he did with is iPad that makes it so indispensable. I only use mine to show my parents things since they&#39;re losing their eyesight, and as a baby cam display. I cannot think of anything I can&#39;t do better on a phone or laptop."
You forgot to ask Tim Cook one question: Why are the vanilla and Plus iPhones still 60Hz refresh rate?
"PLEASE add captions WHEN you upload, not afterwards. It’d be nice to click right after you upload and it has captions already, instead of having to come back hours or days later."
Imagine if all companies were so customer experience forward thinking and quality of life driven
Does he ask about RCS?
He does not know how to ask interview questions 😭
Tim Apple said &quot;windows&quot; 😳😳
"Feels like Tim is getting a lot slower, less sharp as he gets older 😢"
Tim didn&#39;t even know what iPhone Marques had...
ain&#39;t that dude&#39;s name Time Apple?
"Magic Mouse that&#39;s kinda funny, the reaction. <br><br>Knowing fully well I&#39;m an outlier on this, but I&#39;m cool with the Magic mouse. It&#39;s the best mouse I&#39;ve ever had (not saying best mouse in the world.. so chill). I say this with a 10+ year old gen 1 magic mouse and still going. That to me is a successful product. 1 upgrade ever since it was launched and it barely counts since it was the controversial charge point update.<br><br>If we want to fix ergonomically challenging devices I&#39;d have the industry standard qwerty keyboard layout. Keys are staggered for no good reason at all. Think about how awkward typing on a keyboard really is, hours of typing are actually painful. If you don&#39;t like the Magic Mouse you could just get a different mouse but keyboard layout, we&#39;re just stuck with this (the whole world)"
Happy to see this!
Would have been fun if he was sitting there with a Samsung phone 😋
Forgot to ask if he will ever sell the Ipad designed shoes🤣
"I no longer use the iPad, I bought myself a Galaxy Tab S9. The pen is included. The tablet itself is not afraid of water! It is very technological, stable and works for a long time"
When the iPhone dropped having Jobs as it&#39;s main mind. I thought the future was going to change drastically. Nowadays I see Apple doing what China dose to the rest of the globe. Ripping off features created by other companies and having the brainwashed Apple fans fight for their poor lack of innovation. Having an update that gives you the ability to customize your lock screen? Tf is happening in this reality...
No play
I wonder how much do apple engineers tell him or is he that good on telling nothing. Cos this is so high level that it hurts.
Haha he’s so nervous
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a>"
I can&#39;t be the only person reminded of Jack Ma&#39;s &quot;Alibaba Intelligence&quot; when Apple calls AI &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot;
Shoutout to MKHD for supporting indie developer
"It&#39;s hard to be politically correct on the fly. That&#39;s why this conversation was so awkward, lol."
"Hey marques, just curious whether the questions in interviews like this are screened before the interview or whether they don&#39;t reach the final video as they have more impact on the stock market 😅"
Tim apple ❌ <br>Tim brownie ✅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> “The ergonomics of the Magic Mouse” Now we know who designed it.  😅"
Let Tim Cook
My iphone 13 mini died on the hill that is ios 16. Bye bye ios
Somehow this entire interview was cringe to watch. Every question he starts talking about some random uninspiring thing in extreme boring detail. Zero charisma.
“I use the Vision Pro to test Vision Pro apps.  Buy your mom a Vision Pro.”
"As soon as Tim said something about ergonomics on the magic mouse, I stopped the video and went to the comments to see I wasn&#39;t alone... at all."
Marques should be CEO🤣
"Very good questions Marques! Straight up hardballs, right to the point!"
Most hilarious part when Tim was talking about Magic Mouse  Ergonomics 😂😂😂 the close up view 😂😂😂
Hi
tim apple
Apple’s position about protecting against harmful AI misuse is clear in their implementation of image generating AI. I think not allowing photorealistic option is a smart way to stay away from possible controversy.
Cleary it&#39;s not easy having a conversation with Tim Cook in terms of having a back and forth otherwise Marques would have definitely jumped on the Magic Mouse and ergonomics.
Most pr interview I have ever seen
im proud to see how far Tim Cook has went and now gets to interview Marques Brownlee
Tim is sooooo excruciatingly boring to listen to 🙄🔫
"is it just me or was Tim&#39;s foot kinda shaking at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=445"">7:25</a>"
Tim doesn’t understand this game. He was supposed to rank them.
Should have asked him why they hate the iMac and why no iMac pro
The slooooww zoom in on magic mouse
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> 🏅Your well deserved medal for keeping a straight face"
Dont let timm cook 💀<br>There is no need for 4gb ram in the next series
Love the way where both of them were flexing the shoes which were influenced by them 😅
"The last segment is a Trojan Horse Attack on Apple to make Tim talk about the magic mouse and It worked. Woah, Marquess and his team did think about this"
Thanks Tim! My net worth hit a new high today through Apple stock. <br>Let TIM COOK! LET TIM COOK!
Apple as a company does not have a sense of humor and I feel like its CEO is why
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=756"">12:36</a> 😂😂😂"
"Great interview, very interesting to hear Tim&#39;s perspective on GenAI. Apple&#39;s seal of approval typically goes a long way with emerging tech so I&#39;m curious to see how the rest of the field reacts. <br><br>Sidenote, Tim&#39;s biceps are huge . Got that polo sleeve fighting for its life!😂"
Great talk Marques! ✨😉👍
Tim Apple
"Great interview, I just wish you used the last 6 minutes better. Felt like it was wasted and could&#39;ve been used to ask more questions instead of playing the pointless game."
"Were you told to use an iPhone during the interview, or you just thought you&#39;d not bring your Pixel 😂"
I liked the entire video except for the last part (the ranking part) <br>Not gonna lie most of it was bs 🙂<br>But in general it was a great interview
Tim Apples
Dude you get 15 mins with Tim Cook and you spunk a third of it on a blind ranking.
Solid interview. Great job 👏
Can’t wait to see my dead parents on the Vision Pro!
Comment section filled with magic Tim. I mean magic mouse
i need much faster charging for iPhone 16 pro max.
A (sinine) I (ntrusion).
‘Ergonomics’ and ‘Magic Mouse’ in the same sentence hahahahhahaa MKBHD&#39;s face lmaaaaaao that was the best reaction ever hahahahha
"Mac Number 1, without it there would be no Apple. iPod Number 2 it is what created the ecosphere for Apple and changed everything. Number 3 iPhone it revolutionized the Apple Ecosphere and expanded how many Apple products one person could have."
"Well, right now Apple iPhones are only &#39;best&#39; at video, sometimes photos, and also privacy...that&#39;s it.<br>Hopefully Apple Intelligence will be another &#39;best&#39;??"
would really appreciate captions for these kind of videos especially but also in general for every video
"Also, everybody else on YouTube that interviewed Tim sat on a bar stool, but our man going next level bringing out the chairs."
"Tim trying to convince Marques that Apple, primarily a phone company, doesn’t care about how much people look at their iPhones lol. He was biting his tongue as soon as Tim said that"
Should have asked when they&#39;ll start to pay taxes.
How does Tim feel about you using Samsung phones?
"God, save us"
“We didn’t get a blind ranking but we got a retrospective” what a smartass😂😂😂
Great interview!
Tim the only thing we want on iPhone and iPad is sideloading apps. That too not only in the EU but globally as well..! It will make the iPhone and iPad perfect!
Bruh was still in Apple event mode such a marketing guy I must say
Great interview! 👏🏻
Who is this guy anyway
i don&#39;t like soft interviews
"meeting with Tim, you forgot your 24U and moved an iphone 😅😅"
bruh
We are not going to use our phones less.  WTF!  They are unbelievably fantastic technology that connects us to everything.  Why the heck would we use them less??
There seemed to be a lot of tension during the Magic Mouse moment. 😅
I would pay anything to watch Marques interview Steve Jobs.
Tim Cook please do interview with Mrwhosetheboss please 🎉🎉
Marques you killed me 🤣 Your face when Tim talked about the magic mouse 💀
Magic mouse was cap 😂😂😅 it&#39;s the ergonomics guys
bro wearing nike trainers
Imagine he went there with s24 ultra😅
The Tim cook fumbles on this video is like 😢
Let Tim COOK!
Can’t believe Tim said “windows” when talking about multitasking on the Vision Pro
Why is the Mac OS still not touch compatible in 2024?
Apple Intelligence <br>Android Intelligence <br>Same thing ryt 😂
"Did anybody really expect Tim to actually rank historic Apple products, after explaining the whole &#39;no museum, don&#39;t look back&#39; culture?"
"Who let Tim Cook, Cook"
I love how Tim just didn&#39;t play the game😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=460"">7:40</a> wow my respect for Apple is now 10 times more. (I own both, android and iPhone, so plz don’t call me a fanboy)"
Must be an honor to sit with a prominent person and visionary like Marques 😀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> he didn’t let cook cook"
Fraudster..no innovation..only price ..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=472"">7:52</a> 😅 Great reaction and edit! Relevant interview, MKB, Thanks! 😎✌️"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> That zoom into your face followed by &quot;With Magic Mouse ?&quot; had me laughing so hard 😂 If only Tim watched more of your videos..."
Magic Mouse?? Are you fk&#39;ing with him?
Bro the slow focus on Marques face and Tim Cook face when they were talking about Magic mouse got me laughing so hard lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=973"">16:13</a> LOL <br>“Well, we didn’t get a blind ranking.”<br>“Yeah.”"
This felt… unauthentic
why do all tech CEO&#39;s have that specific accent
Scrolling through the comments and pretty much all of them are praising the incredible ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 😂😂😂 AI who?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> I&#39;m dead 😂"
"Marques bringing some spicy questions to Tim, I love it"
Pretty sure Tim forgot about the magic mouse
I wonder if Tim Cook will get my mom an iPhone.
Magic Mouse is just as incredible as Vision Pro is what I’m hearing. Interesting
Who let Tim cook🔥
&quot;ergonomics&quot; and &quot;magic mouse&quot; do not belong in the same sentence.<br><br>this is from a magic mouse user.
I really would have liked Marques to confront him on the Magic Mouse design.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=840"">14:00</a> he definitely don&#39;t use the vision pro"
"&quot;So tell me about the magic mouse&quot;<br><br>Yea, MKBHD is NOT getting invited to wwdc25 😭😭"
He literally gave us zero information. I miss Steve
"MKBHD: “Can I get a blind raking?” <br><br>Tim: “Oh, they were all INCREDIBLE!”"
"Really great interview, the Magic Mouse moment had me cracking up! MOVE THE CHARGING PORT SO WE CAN USE IT!!! Ok, back to work."
"I relate to Tim! I can&#39;t live without my iPad Pro or iPad. I&#39;ve had more iPads than iPhones because they&#39;re such great products. I love my iPad so much that I plan on buying a newer iPad Pro, an Apple Vision Pro, and a newer MacBook Pro this Christmas. However, to save money, I might get the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro used, while purchasing the Apple Vision Pro in-store. I LOVE APPLE PRODUCTS."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=271"">4:31</a> I love that Tim said that they putting it in apps that is already there, because it&#39;s one of reasons why I&#39;m sticking with google assistant rather than Gemini on my android as Geminis is supposed to be a assistant replacement,yet can&#39;t do the basics that assistant can and that&#39;s why I loved the overall to Siri and am hopeful that it isn&#39;t a once off, but that they will continue doing it"
Forgot to troll him and say you are shooting the video with a Samsung…?
he&#39;s never getting another product from them again 💀
"That last part is crazy. When Tim Cock talks about how he reviews photos, and what emotional part Vision Pro has in all this it makes the difference! ❤"
"You are a great interviewer, great questions and good response on him not wanting to give numbers to that ranking, but instead just share his thoughts"
"Tim Cook should be a politician. <br>MKBHD: &quot;So, how are you doing today Tim?&quot; <br>Tim: &quot;I was asked that question on the basis of restraint by which many individuals met within a parameter of self thought in the process of constraints within boundaries of the existence.&quot; <br>MKBHD: &quot;Thanks Tim, I appreciate you talking with me today!&quot;"
The moment when the CEO of the biggest company thanks you for coming. Priceless ;-)
The goats 🐐 ❤️
"I think when Tim said Ergonomics in Magic Mouse, he is talking about touch gestures that allow you to use your desktop Mac like a Macbook or iPad, just because that good made gestures. Not exactly the handling of the device. Also if the Magic Mouse will be big and fat like a regular mouse, your fingers can&#39;t make the gestures you need, it will be a better mouse of course, but a worse Magic Mouse. And yes the charge port is hilarious"
"“It was a big moment”… no, rate it, Tim! 😂"
For that interview he chose to use iPhone Pro and wear Apple Watch 😂
Lol. So they finally forgave you for that beats review?
These two can practically destroy any company.
"Hey, it’s Tim Apple! (Iykyk)"
"Nice interview! Good attitude, open vibe and that quiz makes it playfully interesting! Thanks"
&quot;the magic mouse was also an amazing moment&quot;<br>I cannot contain myself
Value of this Interview: ZERO
Tim got cooked in this one
"Give us 16gb standard, Tim! You won’t!"
I wish Steve Jobs was alive rn. This would be a historic interview
"Typical canned responses any executive gives, nothing to see here."
Hard to take him seriously when he thinks the Magic Mouse is Ergonomic
You can tell Tim isn’t used to talking in unscripted scenarios. His entire life is around schedules and prepared conversations and keynotes.
I wish you would have asked Tim why there isn’t a USB-C Magic Mouse yet lol
"This is nothing short of epic, and only Marques could do this interview and still get invited back next year lol."
Appreciate how Tim Cooks the answers 🙂
The first 5 minutes had some carefully crafted questions. Tough questions...can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t laugh when he said appraised the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse. Good work MKBHD. - You had to sneak in making AI standing for Apple Intelligence.
He ist starting to slide into grandpa mode a bit
No Elon Musk ban question…
Imagine being Apple with unlimited funds and MKBHD videos look better with 3 cameras. STOP USING SHIT IPHONES for your videos Apple.
"Tim trembling before the cancelling power of the MKBHD.<br>He is sweting profuseling, stuttering and praying that he falls into the graces of Mr Brownlee"
I&#39;ve been using the Magic Mouse since it dropped. I didn&#39;t know &quot;people&quot; hated it until YouTubers said it. In the real world it works just fine.
Watching this makes me painfully aware how much more with it Steve Jobs was at interviews.
Why did this interview seem so awkward?
"This is tbh a pretty disappointing interview. I get that Marques is probably handcuffed here, but the questions are softballs where you learn very little about the company that isn’t already said in the keynote or publications."
That&#39;s not an Android phone right? 😅😂
Not too great a liar
"Can we do a pocket check on Mr cook, to see what phone he has. I’m guessing an android foldable lol"
This guy. talking about one of their worst products and how they nailed the ergonomics of magic mouse.... X&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;D <br>Also the 3D effect of the photo&#39;s is nothing more then a gimmick imho... <br>they&#39;ve had something like that for the iPhone backgrounds for years now.... and I don&#39;t think anyone really notices it anymore.
6 minutes in and youre asking the hardest hitting questions bravo. Tim was shaking
"Noobie here, what is Tim Cook&#39;s accent?"
"i dont know much about apple or this guy, but after watching the interview i know that he cant be trusted."
Tim said to mkbhd that thank you for inviting and at the last time said that thank you for coming... wtf? Is that apple head office or mkbhd studio ...😂😂😂
Hell yes. Good interview!
👍👍💯Great interview conversation
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=565"">9:25</a> the time I liked this video because of how well Tim Cook talks about his legacy"
"So it&#39;s painfully obvious Tim was not given the questions beforehand (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a>) 💀"
&quot;The ergonomics was key&quot; 👀 &quot;With Magic Mouse?&quot;
This must really be an amazing experience to sit and talk with Tim. “I’m still gonna ask this question when will Apple incorporate the transfer/sharing of apps between Apple devices”
Magic Mouse 😇 Just want to mention that we finally got here... anything left for classical media companies to do at all ? Congrats on the interview!
People wrapped up around the Magic Mouse part lol. At some point. The interview had more to give than that.
Magic Mouse is just as incredible as Vision Pro is what I’m hearing. Interesting
I wonder what would the world miss out on if apple and all of it&#39;s trash devices suddenly disappeared
What Nikes is Tim wearing? Pretty stylish.
Cook sounds like a South Park character 😂
The most accurate Top Not Top Tier I have seen.
Excellent conversation. You made Tim Cook think so hard that he may think twice about sitting again with you. 🙂
Morale: Really arm yourself for an MKBHD interview lol He really pushed Tim on this one. Good job Marques.
Shoudve been better prepared
I note that Tim Cook has closed all his rings by 3:20 pm.
"You know what would be cool? If someone representing a company played along with the interviewer, made qualitative statements based on their own personal opinions, and demonstrated general awareness about public opinion (see Tim stumble over Magic Mouse comments -- defend it from some angle if you want, but dont pretend you dont know). I would respect them, and their product, far more."
Accepting the newer generation’s context for talking about your company is a smart move for Apple.
yall love to clown on the Magic Mouse but I&#39;ve been using one since 2009 (not the same one obvs)
A very poor interview.<br>Pretending to be an iPhone user in front of Tim Cook 🤣
He has no idea what the Magic Mouse is :)
Ask cook to stop putting gay wallpapers and black history ones too without my permission how do i get rid of them?
i got windows add lmao
I wish he used his android phone to pull up the quote from dua lipa.
Oh my God what a wonderful gentleman.
I like that silence when Cook was asked about Magic Mouse Lol
So many words by tim without saying a single thing
That&#39;s a Royal opportunity to meet the legend and talk to him about the apple evolution great conversation to explain many topics to make people understand  the past and future in many ways to enjoy devices
Most ceo interview answers ever
Mkbhd is more confident than Tim
Calling the magic mouse ergonomical is mad
Marques interviewing Tim then pulling out an Android 😁
holy moly that magic mouse question was evil. loved it
"Killing start-ups by building a similar software and implementing in the OS should have been asked. The tendency gets serious, and needs to set up the boundary."
"blind ranking= huge moment for the company<br><br>my dude, we asked for a number"
Marques said that interviewing someone and bringing up the calculator app for iPad worked so let&#39;s do that with the magic mouse
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> Tim Cook regrets giving the creators a chance to interview him!<br>other creators: letting Tim cook❌<br>Marques: let&#39;s cook Tim✅"
tim sounds like such an old man now lol
Tim Cook sounds just like Mr Garrison 😂😂
Imagine MKBHD likes this comment 😅
Cook Cooked.
"If you’re so forward thinking Mr cook, why has the iPhone been the same damn phone since Steve Jobs passed. Apple today would be sooooo different if we had a true forward thinker. Tim Cook plays it safe with if it ain’t broke don’t fix it philosophy! It’s sad where Apple  is today"
That was a great interview. Blind ranking did make Tim think a lot !! Nice one 👌🏻
Huge props to Marques for not bursting out in laughter during the magic mouse section. 😂
Stop hating on the Magic Mouse. I just wish it was bigger and had a better charging system. Everything else is great
Tim Cook the Biden of Apple
Love the dramatic zooming in on the silly questions... Magic mouse... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tim is like that the 15 🤣
Mkbhd waiting for cooks death. Then he be our apple CEO
Tim is starting to have this Biden’s vibe
"Saw one of these with another creator and Tim had to think of his answers way more in this interview lol. I didn’t expect him to actually rank the products because especially as the head honcho of a public company you don’t want to be on record potentially self sabotaging one of your products, but I did find it hilarious how the camera work made sure to catch your muted shock express when Tim mentioned getting the ergonomics right when speaking of the Magic Mouse lol. If he’s dying on that hill it doesn’t look like it’ll change any time soon unfortunately.  Great interview though."
"I think there needs to be a seriously open, transparent conversation about &quot;data collection&quot;  and &quot;cleaning data&quot;  and &quot;large data models&quot;  as well as the whole &quot;behavioural psychology&quot; aspect of manipulating people with learnings gathered from &quot;data&quot;."
"In Marques&#39;s earlier video the same day he was using a Samsung S24 Ultra while talking about WWDC.  Now, when talking to Cook he&#39;s on an Apple.... I either, A. Want to know what tools he uses to sync his data between devices to make sure a transition from on pair of socks to the next is smooth.. or B.  Want to know what Cooks @$$ smells like."
"Yes, what a great opportunity that Tim had to talk to MKBHD about the exciting new announcements"
"So it&#39;s official now right? He&#39;s made it. Not even in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine that he&#39;d be here sitting next to one of the top names in tech. After more than a decade, Tim Cook can finally say he sat next to the GOAT Marques. This guy is going places!"
Wondering how Tim got this gig ?? 😊
You finally decided to let Tim cook🔥
"Tim definitely has that CEO response system on lock. Sort of answering things but also not really.<br><br>Either way, they have their flaws but I’m absolutely an Apple fan. I love my Apple stuff"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> ??? He clearly didn&#39;t watch the Steve Jobs movie!"
I think ai is so overrated now😂
I learned a whole lotta nothing so far.
Lol the pan to Marques Face when Tim said &quot;getting the ergonomics done was key&quot; - Editor you a fool for this one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was really hard to make the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 😂
The magic mouse LMAOOOOOOOO
biggest oxymoron... apple intelligence
"I see he didn’t dare to put out a galaxy s24 with Tim lol, in his defense that could’ve been seen as an offense in some degree?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=240"">4:00</a> keep it together..."
Why are people hating on the Magic Mouse? I actually like it so I’m confused lol
"Asking Tim Cook abt the Magic Mouse on a Top 5 ranking where there&#39;s the iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, yeaaaah I see you 😂😂"
I wanted Tim to be questioned about the Magic Mouse having the port on the bottom.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=745"">12:25</a> LOL he is dead XD"
"idk if MKBHD or someone on the team will see this but, Does Apple Tell you what you can or can&#39;t not ask ?"
"MKBHD keeping a straight face after &quot;Tim Apple&quot; mentioned the importance of ergonomics on the magic mouse was my favorite moment of this video. Also, I called BS on how Tim uses the Vision Pro. We know that well he never uses that device. 😂"
Would have been crazy if Marques said in the end  it was shot on s24 ultra...
MKBHD the next CEO of Apple??
Best question dodging iv seen.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=567"">9:27</a> &quot;i&#39;m typically always focused on the forward&quot; <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=967"">16:07</a> &quot;looking back... it&#39;s an experience you can&#39;t replicate&quot;"
iJustine was just the tutorial level lol.
Love the logic intros as of late! But the link in description is the wrong song lol
I could fall asleep to Tim Cook any moment
Imagine mkbhd using a samsung or pixel infront of tim cook
The slow zoom in as Tim is trying to say the magic mouse has good ergonomics was hilarious.
DAMN Marques did ask a great question about legacy: “when are you leaving apple? It’s time now right Tim?”
there’s no way this man has ever put on a vision pro
"Tim has great sense of humour, that Magic mouse is ergonomic joke was hilarious."
The self-control of this man watching Tim Cook stumbling to find good things to say about the Magic Mouse is otherworldly. <br><br>I think anyone else in his position would either challenge him on the dumb charger port placement or just burst out laughing when he praised the work done on &quot;ergonomics&quot;.
For magic mouse tim cook has  nothing best to talk 😂
"Wow, a 1-1 interview with CEO of Apple!  Bruh, what a flex."
"next he&#39;s gonna be having a conference with elon, tim, jeff and the whole billionaire shebang 😂😂"
"Tim: Getting the egomaniacs well done was key.<br><br>MKBHDs brain: naa that&#39;s just horrible design it&#39;s not egomaniac,it hurts your hand after using for a while and you have to stop using the mouse if you want to charge it because the charging port is under the mouse (his reaction <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a>😅)<br><br>MKBHD mouth: with magic mouse. Ok"
"That&#39;s not Tim Cook, that&#39;s Tim Apple"
Marques : The Magic Mouse ?<br>Tim : oh sh*t!
Oh gawd that&#39;s probably the most awkward  moment of any tech interview of all time when Tim went like magic mouse was ergonomic 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Tim is only talking to brown because he felt sorry he is blk
"Pushing tim to the limit, maybe the last invitation from Apple 😂"
Vision pro uh uh hmm 🤔 oh i was using it last night 🙄
Infuriating snoozefest corporate answers
"In true dad fashion, he didn’t rank his children but told stories about them."
"MKBHD out here trying to get them to give us a better Magic Mouse, now that they&#39;ve finally given us a calculator and weather app for the iPad lolololol"
Why Tim is nervous than MKBHD
"tim : weve never been motivated by people to spend their lives in front of their phones<br>MKBHD (in his thoughts )  :  hahahahaha are you fucking serious right now  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=427"">07:07</a>"
"Dear Tim, please do the keynotes on stage like before. I really miss that."
@MKBHD - I hope you asked when are Matt Black Macbook Pro are getting Black Chargers.
I LOVE Magic Mouse but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Ergonomics at all.
Marques knew what he was doing including the Magic Mouse in the ranking😂
The Magic Mouse section is hilarious😂
"EPIIIIIC!!!!!! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a>"
"Hold on, isn&#39;t Tim Apple supposed to be ranking the products? He just talks about them and doesn&#39;t give a rank."
Y claro.. Por eso bo tiras la data de que la IA es un modelo malisimo de 2b de params.. Todo predefinido y lo que no funviona todo a gpt jajsjsj<br>Esas ram de 6gb que mezquinaron ahora no les ayuda
"Keeping a straight face while Tim Cook says getting the ergonomics right on the magic mouse was key must have been a challenge lol, using the magic mouse is a challenge"
???
&quot;Apple inteligence&quot; Apple innovation died with Jobs
I’m from India . I don’t know who is he but talks &amp; looks like Joe Biden
I like how he just gave up trying to make Tim rank the products haha.
Boring
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=755"">12:35</a> Talk about putting Tim Cook in a corner and getting yourself not to laugh is beyond me😂. Well played MKPHD!"
Samsung is the best
That man Tim finally gettin his shot
We all thought the same thing when he told him iPhone 15 .
LET HIM COOK!
Magic mouse+ergonomics+zoomed in MKBHD&#39;s=day made
"Hello, @Marques Brownlee, I just wantto take a moment to express my deep appreciation for your remarkable contributions to the world of technology. Here in Mozambique, Southern Africa Region, our access to cutting-edge tech infrastructure may be limited (Apple products in Developed Countries VS in Developing Countries), but your channel transcends geographical boundaries, bringing the latest in tech innovation right to our screens.<br><br>Despite the challenges we face in accessing tech on demand, your channel remains a beacon of knowledge and insight, consistently drawing me back with its engaging content and your unique approach.<br><br>I want to commend you for the incredible work you do. Your commitment to empowering individuals worldwide with your expertise is nothing short of remarkable. Thank you for being a constant source of inspiration and knowledge. Your impact reaches far beyond borders, and your influence resonates beyond borders. Keep up the phenomenal work!"
Lets be honest it’s not like when your using Google that it’s somehow private ?
Avoiding the blind ranking was intentional. Not even Tim can convince otherwise.LOL😂 Great interview.
"Tim Apple, well done, spoken like a true mogul. Looking closely at the interview i truly wish you the best health for the up coming and foreseeable future. Shout out the you MK, you have managed to build your own Apple like status in the community, you&#39;ve held strong to you values and i value you for that. I wish you too the best of health for the foreseeable future."
Tim’s foot is his tell tale. Each time he is uncomfortable to answer the foot points up
"Tim calling the magic mouse ergonomic,<br>Yep he is cooked for sure"
aaahhhhhhh Ergomomics..........Yeah Apple doesn&#39;t do that!!
1 hour ago
GOOD MOOORNINGGG
tbh for marques brownlee and the rest of the tech community this is like interviewing the president
The moment Tim cook fired a shot at MBKHD lol
"Marques saw the comment section in his head <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=753"">12:33</a>"
The look in Tim’s face when magic mouse was mentioned……can’t decide why we made it(ahhaaa ergonomics) xD
Why does this sound so similar the iJustine one?
I love MKBHD as an interviewer. He geningly listens to the guest without interrupting or being annoying
"Tim apple doesn&#39;t even seem to know anything about his own products. The Magic Mouse answer was just making stuff up on the spot. He couldn&#39;t explain why they no longer say &#39;machine learning&#39; anymore, and appeared to not even understand the question. Terrible"
Can I point out that the less we use Apple servers in the name of “privacy” the less Apple has to spend on servers.
As mkbhd said &quot;yeah wev always been doing ai&quot;
The magic mouse is arguably the worst mouse in terms of ergonomics out there yet this is the feature that Tim Cook highlights? WTF?
Did Timmy boy dirty with the Magic Mouse. You could see on his face that he knew damn well that thing has no business existing.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=607"">10:07</a> a very „LeBron-esque“ answer…that made me chuckle…I hope that was sarcasm…😂"
Should’ve asked where that native macOS virtualisation for iPadOS is.
Marques is goated.
Damm......MKBHD should have hold his Galaxy S24 ultra during the interview. 😂
Apple should have also give picture in picture for audio &amp; video apps and give split screens for all apps to work simultaneous and it should be integrated by default in ios and it will also use full power of chip sets. please convey this suggestion to apple (Tim).
Legend talking with someone named Tim
Unrealistic but I wish you roasted him a bit for Apple Watch not being able to properly detect sleep start/end and detecting deep sleep when it&#39;s off the wrist during Sleep Focus mode. I think you made them add calculator to an iPad after all 😂
What a waste of time and energy with the last part omg having Apple&#39;s CEO and asking about his fav Apple products I have no words.
Wtf he is straight up ignoring all your questions😂
Apple got caught napping with AI
can’t believe you didn’t ask Tim about that horrendous customisation change
Ergonomics and Magic Mouse there&#39;s no f*ckin relation
Excellent interview.  MKBHD as the next Apple CEO please.  lol <br>Accessibility tech reviewers need a seat at this same table as well.
The magic mouse and vision pro did time pretty good😂
Great to see MKBHD helping new startups companies 😅
I miss Steve Jobs. His vision was out of the box.!!
Tim Cook corporate is boring.
It’s funny bc I’m actually a fan of the Magic Mouse (don’t hate me) but my least favorite thing about it is def the ergonomics lol
let him cook
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> 😂"
Google: left the chat 😢
Amazing Tim Cook!!
Dubiously repeating &quot;The Magic Mouse...&quot; when he mentioned ergonomics and barely holding back a laugh in front of Tim Apple is insane 💀<br><br>They really need to do a Magic Mouse Pro built for human hands and with a sensor that isn&#39;t 15 years old
Proud of Apple. I never said that before lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> i think tim meant designing the magic mouse in such a way to make it as uncomfortable as they can"
Unpopular opinion... I actually like the magic mouse. The touch scrolling is far better than a wheel and the shape and feel of it is comfortable for my hand. But.... I have had it die once or twice at a bad time and I keep a standby USB mouse just in case. The bottom charging is patently absurd though and nearly ruins the mouse. Before you call me an Apple simp... I use a Windows desktop and a Logitech gaming mouse as my daily drivers. But my old 2015 iMac is still my &quot;creative&quot; computer.
Tim got jokes 😂
I loved how he ranked the products at the end
That face when magic mouse gets pronounced 😆
"at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> i can see you&#39;re trying so hard to hold your laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Love Tim&#39;s Nike shoes!<br>Great interview and so very ,very telling.<br>Apple Intelligence is a game changer and will be seen<br>as monumental and important as was the introduction of the iPhone."
Tim cook is looking pretty geriatric. Nice guy though.
Agghhhh agghhhhhh aghhhh
"Oh man, Marques’ look when Tim says “getting the ergonomics well done was key” with the Magic Mouse! 😂 🤣<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a>"
"Wauw, he’s a really bad interviewee"
"Not a CEO trainer. Why is Tim trained to define even the magic mouse as one of Apple&#39;s memorable product intros? I mean, it obviously makes him look ridiculous and everybody watching this interview will know it, so why?"
You can tell that he&#39;s studied the mannerisms of Jobs.
Why didn’t Tim rank the products 1-5?! 🥲
People need to start complaining about why the older phones won’t get apple ai…
This was a great interview. I feel a lot better about the direction of Apple with context of what they are doing. Having a tech professional ask smart questions made a big difference.
"Marques said &quot;AI&quot; more in his first question, than Apple did in the full WWDC conference."
Man has the stones the troll Tim on the magic mouse. Respect 🫡
How long needs Tim Cook be CEO. Please make him CFO
"I know Apple is purposely avoiding the use of the term “artificial intelligence” primarily for marketing purposes, but I also kind of like it because terms like large language model or machine learning are far more accurate and concise. These systems are a lot of things, but I remain unconvinced that LLMs will ever be “intelligent.”"
I think our man MKBHD has made it! Also Tim struggling to answer the Vision Pro question with lots of “ummmm”’s was hilarious.
"Kinda sus that he uses the exact same answers for some questions as he gave to ijustine, idk sounds a bit rehersed and written by the marketing team. :/"
&quot;Getting the ergonomics right&quot;<br>Magic mouse?<br>&quot;Yeah&quot;<br>LMAO
The magic mouse 🖱 moment! 😂
A kiss up to “interview”
I&#39;m so glad to see you face to face with top brass in companies. It&#39;s good to hear things from the horse&#39;s mouth.
4 videos in 9 days? This is special!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> not Tim checking to make sure Marques got an iPhone 😭"
I love the blind ranking questions… not so much Tim’s response but great question MKBHD…😆😆😁
"He didn’t exactly do a blind ranking, but what he did was pretty smart.<br><br>It’s like ranking yourself or someone else through the process of developing softwares and hardwares. It’s pretty tough to do that because your vision is to all give the developers the best of what they can work with, with them.<br><br>It’s not a one man or a few people job, it is the world of Apple users to decide how the next software may improve the hardware and even give an idea to what the next hardware may be."
Ask Tim Cook to ban Xitter and Tesla. I want to see Elon throwing the tantrum of all tantrums 😂
Who was waiting for Marques to pop out an s24 ultra 😂
September event apple updates the magic mouse to be more relevant lol 😂😂 creds to marques 👏🏼👏🏼
Every single comment on here is about the Magic Mouse lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=325"">5:25</a> he didnt think it was an iPhone did he? haha"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a>"
I feel like he&#39;s never answering the questions straightly
"16 minutes, and thanks to Tim&#39;s &quot;answers&quot; I&#39;ve learnt nothing."
exstablishing
"MKBHD…. tough but fair. I’m glad he asked some less “lowball” questions as iJustine and Safwan but he didn’t overstep any boundaries. I know what he was doing with stuff like putting the MAGIC MOUSE of all things in the blind ranking &amp; saying things like “I’m curious, what do YOU do with the Vision pro?” i would love him to be more aggressive with blatantly challenging Tim for the objectively weak mouse design (charging port placement, flat ergonomics etc) and Vision Pro being incredible hardware… but with not much to do on it in this early Series 1 iteration. Bravo"
Tim “Keep the investors happy but not the consumers” Cook
You should&#39;ve ask him about Elon getting salty 😂
"If there&#39;s a master of evading questions while it being obvious but not giving a shit about it, Tim Cook takes the cake."
Yo the Magic Mouse..😁
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=445"">7:25</a> that&#39;s Zuckerberg"
"MKHD you have a lot of respect to hold yourself at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a>"
"Honestly this just makes me sad for Steve Jobs’s legacy. I know Tim has his strengths. But candid speak and vision (no pun intended) is not one of them. Steve Jobs would have throw the Magic Mouse out the window many years ago, and would have trashed it in this interview."
great interview !!
Disappointed there was no RCS questions lol
Magic Mouse? Camera slowly zooms in on Tim Apple😂
Marques&#39; face when Tim talked about the ergonomics of the magic mouse 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone ready for my super original comment? That face Marques made when Tim talked about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse! Haha am I right?? Told you my comment was super original! You won’t see anyone else here in the comments mention that!
It&#39;s kind of sad how Mkbhd has gone to bed with big tech. I suppose the money is probably too good
Bro the magic mouse i think i died a lil inside hahahahahha 😂
Big moment for Tim Apple.
you mention the &quot;magic mouse&quot; and didn&#39;t mention the usb port?!?!?!
Seems like Tim Cook never used the Magic Mouse.
Mmm…
&quot;The Magic Mouse&quot; 💀😭
“Extablish”
Nice interview. What&#39;s the name of that song at the end?
They never give Marques good lighting at these Apple events. If it wasn&#39;t for the WW behind him and the palms of his hands he&#39;d blend right into the wall lol
This guy talks like someone applying to a job interview
Seeing Marques’ face when Tim is talking about the magic mouse’s ergonomics. 😂
I just got iPhone 14 Plus will IOS 18 work on it and the new Siri?
lol like he was EVER going to rank the products on a scale... ZERO chance of that. Who thought that was a good idea?
"Its with no doubt that if you can harness the goodness of machine intelligence you have by have already harnessed its badness....<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/YvgfY-LIBpjChgHKyYCQBg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/YvgfY-LIBpjChgHKyYCQBg""></a>😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> He didn’t just say that"
"Why did you go from not using the word AI to rebranding it Apple Intelligence?<br>Well, we really wanted to embrace it.<br>Okay... next question.<br>Really??!?"
can we buy those water bottle?
nice
Damn! That’s an exclusive interview 👑
No blind ranking answers  :’(
the way he speaks is annoying.... why is he dragging every sentence... lol
"This is like a caveman saying Fire will not spread! Listen if AI is handling your data its only a matter of time before it will escape either by hacking or by by AI itself abusing the info. AI already is as smart as anyone on earth just ask ChatGPT 4.O anything! Do you know the answer? No bit it does! Fast forward this 10 years?!!! What Tim is saying is almost laughable! Like Oppenheimer saying, &quot;lets stop nukes now!&quot; Only difference is these nukes have a &#39;mind&#39; of their own!"
Love that he&#39;s a billionare with Nike glasses
"That slow zoom in on MKBHD at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> felt like the cameraman trying to get his ass in trouble lol"
Marques!! I appreciate your channel! Amongst the best of the tech YouTubers. Always professional and respectful.
Apple def making a new mouse after this interview 😂
2.2K
Marquez trying not to bust out laughing when Tim calls the magic mouse “ergonomic”😂
"Marques, you are so mean..... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a>. 😜"
"I wish you ask him while talking about MacBook Air, about if iPad Air still nees to stay since it is thicker than others"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=702"">11:42</a> I love how Tim Cook says what I’ve always thought about how Apple works. They don’t care about being first; they care about being the best. So many mp3 players were already out there when the iPod came out, but the iPod steadily became the best and most well known. It’s what they want to be for every product category they ship a product for."
Mkbhd u did that on purpose 😂😂 Magic Mouse lol 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=670"">11:10</a> &quot;The first one, it wasn&#39;t about how many people would buy it. It was about establishing the foundation&quot; - that&#39;s why the Apple Vision Pro will succeed."
"&quot;So I&#39;ve been using tim cook for a couple of weeks now , here&#39;s my opinion about him&quot;"
Did Tim Cook? Or is Tim cooked
He didn&#39;t even play the ranking game he went on rambling 💀💀
"IMO, Craig Federighi will be the next CEO"
"TODO LO QUE JUSTINE NO PREGUNTO, ACA LO PODRAS ESCUCHAR!"
So he never ranked the five things. Guess we&#39;ll never know... 😂🤷
It would have been much more exciting if he had taken his S24U in the meeting with Tim
"Tim leads the biggest company right now and suddenly he sounds so silly. M can see through his sleep inducing jargon. Sadly, he’s sucked the innovation out of an amazing company and taken Apple into a tight corner, that’s unfortunately boring. No intelligence can help him cook a new recipe. Awesome, Thinnest, Best ever, never before, incredible bull s&amp;@t."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=577"">9:37</a> I realise that’s honestly a bold decision to take"
I hate MKBHD
"U had Iphone with you on sofa... u should put Android there, like a badass"
"haha i love when he had to think of anything good to say about the magic mouse, knowing most people hate it xD always nice to see these type of intrerviews though"
An economic system and company that doesn&#39;t care about anything but profits for shareholders and bottom lines should not be given this much power. You would think Tim has humanity&#39;s welfare at heart. Gtfoh <br><br>Once AI makes daycare affordable and redistributes wealth then I&#39;ll care what scumbag CEOs have to say
"&quot;I won’t miss the old Marques, playing it safe Marques<br>I like the new Marques, throwing curveballs in interviews, Marques  <br>Bankrupting companies in his reviews, Marques<br>Edgy and bold Marques, always keeping it real, Marques&quot;"
"Would be interesting to hear Tim’s views on Chat GPT, given that it is trained to lie. Elon Musk said recently that an AI that’s trained to lie is a very dangerous thing"
LMAOO on magic mouse!!!
Tim Cook: It was great fun! Thank you for coming. <br>MKBHD: Yeah...sure
Ergonomics… magic mouse…. O.K.
Could someone tell me what the Tim Cook&#39;s shoe model is?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> “ergonomics well done” and then look at Marques’s face 😂😂😂😂"
Him talking about the magic mouse made him look so out of touch....
Tim answered every question without answering a single question....
Ayo Tim got an interview with my boy 😂❤
I don&#39;t think TIm understood the blind rankings lmaooo
Pretty disappointing party-line style answers by TC. I miss Steve.
Before watching I have a dread over me that mkb isn&#39;t gonna challenge him in any of his statements and he will side with the company over consumer like he did when talking about the apple monopoly lawsuit
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=323"">5:23</a>  he looked at his own phone like trash for a min. then said, oh sh*t that&#39;s an iPhone. 🤣"
Tim Apple finally get to meet his childhood hero
Magic Mouse and ergonomics??? <br>Marques was fighting desperately to keep a straight face 🤣🤣🤣<br>I was dead on the floor laughing when the zoom started!!!
i wish i was tim cook. Would be so cool to meet MKBHD
Tim Cook is insane if he thinks the Magic Mouse is an example of getting ergonomics right. I&#39;m in literal disbelief.
I&#39;ve watched this thrice now for no particular reason
I feel like about 10% of what Tim said is genuine and personal. The rest is PR coached. Cannot be otherwise. I feel like we will never know what he really thinks as an individual about certain topics. Polar opposite to Elon Musk. Not sure which is better tho.
2 goats being goats
Wish tim fully played the game instead of just talking abt the products 😂
Artıq kasıb adamların iphonedan istifadə etməyi mənim iphone almaq həvəsimi çox azaltdı və azaltmağa davam edir
Tim been lifting those weights 💪
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> shut the duck up is what MKBHD wanted to say <br>The mouse is non useable and is the worst mouse in terms of it&#39;s shape"
The video quality is C R I S P.
"It was so obvious Tim was so caught off guard by Magic Mouse he didn’t have anything good to say about it, and just say whatever random positive thing he can think of on the spot 😂"
People complaining about a CEO being careful with his answers about a $2 trillion company that had its IPO doubled recently is funny. Of course he’s going to be careful. His words can deeply hurt the company and there are so many examples of it happening.
Alternative title: Tim Cooks
"Seriously, what other content creator is doing interviews with Tim Cook? MKBHD is really that guy."
Boy almost had him not being businessman 101 until the last section. Went from an interview to a mindless press release.
&quot;fun&quot;
Lets go Volkswagen DC!
Misspelling of one word from tim can end apple&#39;s career 💀
"MKB showed restraint and professionalism throughout, even making sure to only take his iphone, leaving the main phone, an android at home, lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=736"">12:16</a> previewing the 251 low tops"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> now it makes sense"
"I love the part where Tim hesitated a bit before reaching for MKBHD’s phone, unsure if it was an iPhone :D"
MKBHD: the Magic Mouse<br>Tim: Wow that was uhh also an incredible moment
Tim is so well media trained that he DID NOT fall for that rank game at all<br>He just rambled on without giving it a rank to each prompt haha<br>What a master at this
Getting the ergonomics well done is a key... Marques: With the Magic Mouse????  😀
Tim was cooking in this one
so little meaning in so many words
You’re such a great interviewer Marques!
Magic mouse and ergonomics? RIP MX Master 3 and 69 others....
"w for stumping Tim on the Magic Mouse, maybe we get a new one soon 😭"
Logic Clone wars III on the intro?
"So, Tim Cook&#39;s rankings are:<br>- Mac Air = huge<br>- iPad = huge<br>- Magic Mouse = incredible <br>- iPhone = world changing <br>- Vision Pro = uhhhhh...useful"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=727"">12:07</a> ask for Mac os on ipad and see his response"
Marques is a great interviewer. Props.
&quot;The magic mouse&quot; then gave him that look 😂😂
A sales rep at apple store does a better job than this guy! Useless watch
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=883"">14:43</a> he said the thing"
"MKPHD goes hard on Apple. MKBHD is Apple in the creator world, both are 19M. Apple does things in the &#39;&#39;Apple way&#39;&#39; and here MKBHD goes &#39;&#39;&#39;MKBHD way&#39;&#39;<br>Marques you should&#39;ve got the s24 instead of the 15 pro. lol!"
I just wanted it to be known for everybody… He in fact said AI😂😵☠️ at 43 sec. but in his head it was “Apple Intelligence”. 🤣🤣🤣
That’s Apple Intelligence on display right there. They seem to have replaced their CEO with some kind of corporate bot that only answers with officially approved answers.
Can&#39;t decide if Tim sounds like Mr Mackey from South Park. Sometimes slow like Biden. Then at times he does the same pauses as Steve Jobs (when saying &quot;And&quot;) when he tries to make a point.
The way Tim navigates questions needs to be studied
Magic Mouse. That’s just decredibilised the entirety of his discourse.
"Ive noticed over the years that youve become an apple shill, but damn this is another level. <br><br>Mf like &quot; EVERYONE!! I, MARQUESS BROWNLY, LOVE APPLE CORPORATION WITH ALL MY HEART!!&quot;"
"I think Apple, out of all the companies, is the only one to think this through in a way that makes sense for the users. I&#39;m extremely impressed with their implementation of artificial intelligence. I&#39;m honestly becoming a bit of a fanboy now, ever since I got my MacBook Pro. I wish we could upgrade SSDs. When it comes to privacy issues and the way features work in the integrations and so many things, compared to Microsoft, they&#39;ve knocked it out of the park. And compared to most 90% of hardware manufacturers, even then, they&#39;re tied with the best in making their devices the most durable, sleek, modern, and nice to use. And even though I don&#39;t trust any major company, especially for privacy, I got to say I do mostly trust that they&#39;re going to do what they say. I really like the way they&#39;re going about this all. We should have the choice. Microsoft continues to push features that no one asked for down its users&#39; throats. It&#39;s good to see Apple LOL &quot;thinking differently&quot;."
"tim cook put that perfectly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=55"">0:55</a>"
Appearing here was a smart move for Tim. I learn more from you than Apple.
Tim is nervous because MKBHD could end Apple/s
you knew what you were doing with the magic mouse question
Tim Cook got them forearms
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=138"">2:18</a> that was weird, any thoughts why?"
What an amazing CEO
I wonder if a new apple ceo once Tim is gone would just kill apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a> The Magic Mouse moment with Tim looking confused 🤔 will be memed"
This is insane. Apple being so open wasnt something i expected at the begginings of the decade
"Apple refused to say AI in their keynote, so Marques says it in the opening as may times as possible."
"MKBHD is officially an Apple product now, launched at WWDC24 ! 🎊 🎉😊😂"
Apple Supports and Donates to israeli army organisations btw
Elon: 🍎 + AI = 💀
The fact that he mentioned Magic Mouse is top tier.
He sounds like Mr garrison from South Park lol
Wtf. Tim Cook got to talk with MKBHD? I&#39;m jealous AF.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=320"">05:20</a> has tim accidentally leaked that the iphone 16 pro will get m1? 😂"
I hope I am not the only one speeding up the parts where Tim speaks
"You can just see the gears turning when Marques asks about the magic mouse, it was part &quot;wait that&#39;s something we sell&quot; and &quot;OH that thing, something good about, something good about...&quot;"
DUDE HOW?????????
Does everyone that interviews Cook seem out and kiss his butt and never ask just one real hard hitting question  !
VMVDC24
Tim is so good at saying so many things but also nothing at all
Did he say new CEO?
I guarantee you the ONLY reason Marques had the blind ranking at the end was to make Tim talk about the Magic Mouse. He looked genuinely caught off guard lmao.
Vision Pro for consumers = you can obsess over lost loved ones. If that’s your sort of thing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marques the Will Smith sad stare meme😆"
Come on Tim before you give your position give us new Magic Mouse!
“How would you rank this?”<br>“Yes”
The ergonomics🤣🤣
The look on Marques when Tim mentioned ergonomics for the magic mouse... Priceless!
Is it just me or Tim has a slight Australian accent 😂
this interview feel so off i can&#39;t stop laughing for the things that are not said
A CEO talking with Marques is a huge step forward
Product placement by Nike there 😂
poor tim had to try to say how amazing that mouse is without preparation hahaha
proud of you Marques
Magic mouse :D
"Marques face when Tim mentioned ErGoNoMics! He literally double checked with Tim! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a>"
Too bad iMac wasn&#39;t mentioned. I&#39;m dying to get a bigger iMac that can do all the things we could do on Intel-based iMacs. 😭
I hate when corpos refuse to have fun or speak off the cuff during segments like this. How hard would it have been for Tim to play along and just give a number for each product? Is he that terrified of the numbering affecting sales of these products? It&#39;s a bloody PR puff piece moment-- just have fun with it!
This is like listening to a politician.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> Tim had a mini panic attack thinking that was not a iPhone"
Tim is being grilled by these questions
"lol he is NOT using the Vision Pro for the multiple windows, come on!"
Would be great if iJustine and MKBHD &amp; other techtuber shared their questions among each other to get the max juice out of these interviews.
Shot out to the editor for the Magic Mouse portion!
"Ah man, the smile on his face when he couldn&#39;t tell which particular iphone model it was... yikes"
we got magic mouse &#39;ergonomics&#39; before gta 6
Well played 🤣
Mouse trap
He’s forgetting about Vision Pro these are your eyes!!!
It’s nice to see somebody so important in the tech community. Take the time of the day to do an interview with Tim Cook good interview MKBHD.
Based on Tim&#39;s reaction this are his top 5 Apple products <br>1. IPhone <br>2. Macbook Air <br>3. Vison Pro <br>4. IPad <br>5. Magicmouse
"I use apple and Android and I can totally appreciate on both sides the technology advancement. Both are for two different audience or an audience which understands the implications of using both. I can really appreciate the security that Apple have, however for someone which likes an open source mindset I like the freedom of android also. As apple slowly open up (which they are while adding security) I am totally behind and will totally move to an apple ecosystem fully when this does happen. I am pro technology and I love seeing the competition that the industry has. Apple is ahead in ways that android isn&#39;t and this also goes vice versa. Tim and the the whole company are really proving that apple will be a superior product as long as they push people first. I would love a world that google would also be more secure and stop sharing data however that is the market they are in"
This was an amazing interview
Let Tim Cook
"Omg, his glasses are AI-equipped too."
The Magic Mouse was just mean 😂
"I think they did the blind ranking wrong. I liked the interview but the Magic Mouse moment was just hilarious, I wonder if Tim Apple knew how he was set up."
"Really loved that instead of trying to get Tim to slip up and get bad wording out of him, Marques just accepted all the answers as they were given. Seemed like neither one was uncomfortable in the interview which could&#39;ve totally been the case if they had kept talking about flaws etc."
No answers. just vibes lol
AMAZING INTERVIEW WITH SENSAI TIM COOK. <br><br>HE IS COOKING WITH APPLE INTELLIGENCE
"He gives me Biden vibes, he almost asked back do we really have that thing?? I believe he’s not very passionate about everything but engaged on the new stuff, also it hurts saying no museum, it’s good to know who you were and your future vision, not recognizing that is just throwing to the garbage the Steve’s legacy 🗑️"
"Marques has gotten a lot more bold in his interviews, going as far as asking the CEO to blind rank his own products 🤣. I love it! Forbes would never."
"I laugh at the fact Apple got so many people to wear the ugliest watches ever, and think they are cool. lol"
"I think a lot of digital dependency stems from FOMO, and as people are able to get summaries and smart alerts that fear will somewhat subside so people can be more present"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> You can very well see Marques holding his laughter when Ergonomics and Magic Mouse are mentioned in the same sentence"
I think him making personal about losing his parents show how comfortable he is with speaking with MKHB. Also great questions!
I like how Tim is pretending to understand technology. The only thing he&#39;s thinking is how many SKUs can I create from this one product.
"I’m so sad Tim didn’t play along. Come on Tim, give some numbers!"
can´t believe you got tim apple to come
marcus was  literally tryna stop laughing magic mouse - ergonomics lol
There are so many ‘ughhhhh’. All at the best moments.
"Tim Cook doesn’t play games (literally, the end was just him saying everything is amazing :("
HAHAHAH TIM CHOKED ON CLOUD COMPUTE LMAO
Wow
"Great interview, and we&#39;re so close to beating Apple in subscribers! Maybe that will spur them to make a different new phone 😂"
Shady stuff
his haircut is fire
“Getting the ergonomics well done”<br>“On the Magic Mouse?”<br>“The Magic Mouse.” <br>😂😂
This man had 4 talking points that he repeated 9 times each
Not the vest interview. I love you markes
I’m joining the channel membership only because you asked him about the Magic Mouse and didn’t laugh 😂😂
Listening to Cook Tim speak is quite interesting.
🤔 is that buzz from AC
"You have to respect MKBHD, got to where he is from hard work, dedication and maybe a slice of good timing.... Even with all this success, he still has time to interview small tech start-ups like this. Keep smashing it bro!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> Loved the part where Tim couldn’t even recognise the model of his own product"
Kudos to Tim Cook for being willing to speak to journalists outside the mainstream sphere. Definitely opens up to more challenging and off-the-wall topics. He handled it well.
You should have said to his face man
"holy shit this is HUGE for you! Can&#39;t believe how far you&#39;ve come, says a lot about your talent and determination that you&#39;ve got to this point - you really deserve all the success you&#39;re seeing and getting massive opportunities for videos like this is testament to all the hard work! Well done Tim!"
"Not the best questions but not the worst, their screening must be insanely rigorous"
Whats up with the audio on this one? it feels like a very large soundstage or hollow sounding.
<i>Buy yOuR mOM aN iPhOne</i>
he could be a politician
No pride question? Missed opportunity
Dude your poker face is crazy
"&quot;I never look back, Darling. It distracts from the now.&quot; -Tim Cook"
"I understand that he’s representing arguably one of the biggest companies in history, but it feels like every single word he’s about to say is overthought and almost robotic. It’s like he has an earpiece with the parameters that he should use. Not natural at all."
Man is the best CEO of the past 10 years and is as humble as he probably was before it all.
Wouldn&#39;t this cause a conflict of  interest as a reviewer?
Good try on getting Tim to us more about everything Apple 😁👏🏼
"&quot;our objective is not to be first, its to be the best&quot;<br><br>wise wise words"
You took your iPhone for the interview lol. Although your daily driver is an android phone
Marques: What is AI for Apple?<br>Tim: Yapp... yapp... yapp...
"From doing tech reviews in the bedroom, to having an established business, large office space and interviewing the CEO of Apple. Respect the hustle fr!!"
"The ergonomics of the Magic Mouse, uh huh sure Tim"
We need a full review of Tim Cook
Marques is crazy for casually dropping Magic Mouse in this. THAT WAS A LITERAL PIPE BOMB!!! Lmao.
That Magic Mouse moment 😂
Tim Apple!
Another non answer interview
Did he let you check his internal battery levels after the interview?
The truth is apple makes half of the profit from indian market due to high prices. Customs and taxes are high but when you manufacture in india relatively price should be reduced but i do not see any price vary.
"Jeez the amount of cynicism in this comment section<br><br>It&#39;s still a cool interview, nice to see some (even if very apple coated) insight from Cook"
Don&#39;t understand why this wasn&#39;t titled &quot;letting Tim Cook&quot;
Let Tim cook
"I&#39;m 2 seconds in and if he doesn&#39;t ask about RCS, we riot. I know it&#39;s an AI convo, but still."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=332"">5:32</a>, Tim Cooks thougt: oughøø which Iphone is that actually?"
Why does he answering like &quot;Miss Universe&quot; for every question 😵‍💫
❤❤keep it up like this<br>Masha allah🎉
The magic mouse if the worst product of all time
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Maeques trying his best not to laugh🤣"
"The perfect selection of questions, could have even made Tim nervous. Loved it."
I feel like Tim Cook lies a lot
Did Tim even answer any questions from Marques?
Microsoft is learning what privacy means.  I’m glad that Apple already comes to the table with this knowledge.
"He did everything right, but he didn&#39;t do things he didn&#39;t."
Impressive how Marquess sweater color is different from the thumbnail...
I am glad MKBHD got Tim Cook to say AI three times lol
"I believe Tim Cook believes that sending data to OpenAI won&#39;t invade Apple customer&#39;s privacy. But I also believe Elon Musk who says that Apple has no idea what is going on with the data once it is in OpenAI&#39;s hands. OpenAI could build a model of the users through time, by identifying certain metrics that are embedded in the requests themselves. Through time OpenAI would develop a model of who you are, even if they don&#39;t get a direct name attached to any single request sent to them from Apple."
It&#39;s crazy how CEO Jack ma said AI stands for Alibaba Intelligence....Now here we have another CEO implying Apple Intelligence
“The magic mouse? Okay!” 😂😂😂😂
aint no way
"One of the differences between Jobs and Tim is Jobs had the guts to give a honest opinion publicly.<br><br>You can find several videos of Jobs talking about his failures, but Cooks couldn’t even rank an Apple product."
Tim doesnt use the Vision Pro lol
First thing to do after the interview is changing the magic mouse 😂
Free palestine 🇵🇸
Every product Tim gets presented with: Oooohhhhhh
I lost my shit at the Apple mouse part 😂
<b>My boy Marques is now doing side quests and I&#39;m all for it!!</b>

"The iPhone changed the world indeed. Creating a new worldwide addiction, accelerating a decline in mental health and ruining avery single concert."
Dua Lipa asked infinitely better questions than you it’s embarrassing.
Tim seemed nervous and not really answering the question. Also i wonder if there is some limitation of his knowledge to answer the questions. Perhaps Craig Federighi might be better suited to answer some of those challenging question. Good interview
Hey thats tim apple😂
tim apple you goat
It was going so well until the Magic Mouse came along
I can see him barely holding his laughter
In the Background it says VWDC not WWDC - VolksWagenDC 🤣
"What I learned: Tim is an excellent spokeperson, his responses were 100% marketing, and almost zero personal thought."
Is that man the right person to be the CEO of Apple or there is something hidden because with his leadership I don’t see Apple evolving like Steve Jobs so what really happening
"Tim really didn&#39;t want to diss the Magic Mouse. In fact, he went the opposite way and said the ergonomics are excellent. Oh my..."
"Marques you made it. Good work, critical thinking, good morals, and you are at the top -congrats!"
They really didn&#39;t let you bring your S24 Ultra into the interview huh? lmao
Who else noticed that Marques changed the good ol S24 Ultra for an iPhone for this interview 😅
Novedad de Apple 2024: Poder personalizar Widget.....
Missed the chance to call this &quot;Cooking with Tim Cook&quot;
Basically Best Friends
I wish any main stream politician could speak about current affairs with the same level of understanding as Tim Cook talking about Apple
Is it just me or did Tim say a whole bunch of nothing? Feels like he doesn’t really know what he’s talking about with the AI stuff
the magic mouse XDDD
nice
We need Craig next.
"Lol love how mkbhd pulls out an iPhone for the occasion whereas he&#39;s using the s24u as his main, even during the recap of the event he did yesterday"
"Tim Cook is really a nice guy, and Apple is a really great company, with nice products."
"I think Marques is awesome, but I sorta think he&#39;s sorta grown out of the position of new kid on the block and I think for some of the mid-late tenured people he&#39;s been around, there&#39;s some lost charm in the discussions."
Wish you asked him about the actual delivery dates for all the things Apple talked about at WWDC they quick would say coming later and move on.   Seems like some of this could still be way down the road.
MKBHD holding back his laugh and objections while Tim talking about the magic mouse is hilarious
Corporate devil 👿👿👿
damn you got Tim Apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=321"">5:21</a>"
Do we still have to sell our kidneys to afford apples?!
Did he just call the Magic Mouse ergonomic 💀
The way he talked about privacy Apple really don&#39;t want another lawsuit 😭
That was really beautiful meeting
when I think about the Magic Mouse the first thing that comes to mind is ergonomics 👀
Xiaomi is better
I only have one question for Tim Cook: when are you retiring?
Tim cooked
tim cook is zaddy. oh my he is so cute.
Magic mouse 😅
"why didnt you ask about iPadOS and why is the iPad so bad and just a big phone, why cant iPad get macOS, mkbhd I thought you can say what you want, we all want apple to make the iPad better"
Let Tim Cook!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 one know other know that 1st know dammm"
MKBHD pushed Tim to the brink in this interview.  Great job
This was good 😊
You just saved my lunchtime lol
Marques isn&#39;t getting invited to the next Apple event lol.
"This is incredible, watching a YouTuber interview one of the most powerful people on the planet. I also can’t wait for Apple AI when writing emails and assignments in the future."
"got em with the magic mouse..<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
😅 Magic Mouse and Ergonomics in the same sentence Tim? Even he was embarrassed to talk hahaha  😂
Marques is the Marquis.
just feels like he knows nothing much about the actual products
Interesting
I loved the editing on the magic mouse part😂
Did he put on his Apple gadgets just for the interview? Lol
how far companies are willing to go to push a narrative and pander
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=736"">12:16</a> they will never call you back 😂😂😂😂 dammmm no bro you go far"
His face after the Magic Mouse ergonomics line lmao
"Come on tim, magic mouse is an easy 6!"
So who is going to give me the details about Tim cook’s watch rings?
Can we all give Mariah (team member) an applause for zooming in on Marques face during the magic mouse part👏👏
Tim Cook reminds me<br>Of Joe Biden and I don’t like it one bit
The fact that Tim couldn&#39;t tell which iPhone marques has was hilarious!!
The slow zoom into Marques face when Tim is mentioning “Ergonomics” is priceless
“People wanted to know our views on gen AI” - the board has been on my ass everyday asking when Apple can deploy gpt
"MKBHD went there — Apple Intelligence or is it Artificial Intelligence!<a href=""UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ/pLvlW_OLG6HZ8gSt46Zw""></a>"
I feel the whole point of the blind ranking was just to get Tim to comment on the magic mouse and probably never about any of the other products 🤣
Failed blind Ranking :)
"Apple Intelligence… shoot me now… also stop lying Apple, all your privacy crap doesn’t mean a thing as soon as you use ChatGPT or Googles AI. Your website states as such."
How did you not laugh during the Magic Mouse segment 😂 - I&#39;m so glad you asked him
Sold my IPad . Well done Apple for not improving ipadOS  I’m now done 👍
Tim Cook is so f scared after looking at whatever happened to humane lmao
The zoom in for the magic mouse question was hilarious
The lights on Marques are sooo awful. And he looks so tired and stressed. Kudos from doing a good interview with someone who doesn&#39;t play the game.
Barbara!
I want a fight with Mkbhd vs Tim Cook ufc fight sponsor Jake Paul 😂😂
How great of Marques to make time in his schedule to talk to Tim.
😮😮🔥🔥🔥💪🏼
You had to mention the magic mouse lol
Magic Mouse did it for me 😂
What Tim&#39;s gonna do with all of this privacy and security features when all it takes a phone call from CIA to avail all of that?
That was the greatest non answer I&#39;ve ever heard
Tim interview with Marques is truly big but the Dua Lipa one caught me off guard lol
imagine adding “mmmm..kayyy” to every Tim’s sentences😂
"Great that I just learned that Google will be hosting that shit AI stuff. Great, first OpenAI, now Google. What next? Obeying the NSA and handing out private data? WTF is up with Apple?????"
You Know when Tim invites the most famous tech reviewer there&#39;s something fishy going on..
Legacy=ego so I hired he isn’t worried about that
"He is the most nothing saying human on planet earth.<br>He should become a politician. He would fit right in.<br>Don&#39;t have a strategy, don&#39;t have a vision, just doing mundane day to day tasks every day miniscule better. That&#39;s what Apple has become."
Tim Cook for president 👉
The greatest product reviewer of all time.
Let&#39;s talk about how the magic mouse is charged.   🤔
MARK SHOULD OF PULL OFFf HIS SAMSUNG S24 ULTRA!!
MKBHD has collabed with EVERYONE at this point
You&#39;ve made him say &quot;ai&quot;. :&gt;
Horrible questions he’s never talking to you again
omggggggggggggggggggg
Marcus: Magic Mouse ?<br>Tim Cook: blah blah blah blah blah blah
👁️✍️
Marcus you fuckin legend xd
"C’mon man, why didn’t he rank them? Cuz it might discourage the employees? If this was Musk, he would absolutely rank his companies products."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=545"">9:05</a> answer:  profit!"
Gay Interview
just rank your products why do ceos have the human nature of a robot
Vision Pro and Magic mouse must be sooo much on the last of the ranking. It’s a crime to be worthy to be on the ranking even. That’s how bad the Magic mouse is.😂💀
"How did they erase the word, artificial intelligence from apple employees vocabulary ? 😂"
this chanel is rock
Good to see that Tim already got 88min of exercise by the time of the interview. He puts a workout in everyday
I can imagine what went through the mind of both when Marques said: “The Magic Mouth”.
Tim: uuuhhhhh uuuuuhh uuuuuhh uuuuhhh...
Look!!! 2 Influencers with 19MIL Followers EACH!
You should collaborate with Mrwhosetheboss again
you can see him calculating everything he says lol
The Magic Mouse was setup question
Magic mouse = ergonomics ❤ well said Tim anna
Marques really was able to keep his face straight when Tim Apple mentioned the well done ergonomics of the magic mouse 😂
So where is the blind ranking? Did he just skip the ranking part?
He’s getting free iPhone for life lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=278"">4:38</a> ummm.... iCloud?"
I think that MKBHD is a funboy of the Apple😁
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=543"">9:03</a> really you asked for that 😂 (Craig) ❤"
I miss Steve Jobs. He was just sooooo exciting to watch. But I also must commend Tim cook for his execution. <br><br>Great interview MKPHD!
Sweet
Best blind ranking I’ve ever seen
This interview was hard to watch. It’s like when you’re doing a presentation at school and the teacher says to expound on a topic and you’re just reading back the notes you got in class for same topic😢
Marques trying to keep a straight face when the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse being well done was being discussed had me laughing out loud.
"You got him at Magic Mouse. Good one, Marques!"
This might have been a unbox therapy bending the iPhone 6 moment. Marques may not get an invite to more Apple events 😆
He wanted to laugh so hard while talking about mouse 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great questions Marq! I see Tim running out of thoughts for Magic Mouse…I would rate the Magic Mouse to be the worst product in their portfolio.
iAI
He didnt even rank them man
Daam his so good on not answring question 🧐
Amazing interview
"I&#39;ve always been a big Apple fan....BUT, I would not have stopped to watch this video if Marques was not in the other chair."
The look in Marques’ eyes when he asked the Magic Mouse. IYKYK
"The Magic Mouse answer was like when the teacher asks you a question but you were talking to a classmate and didn’t hear it. “Uhh yeah really great, ergonomics”"
Today I realized how less of a product person Tim really is as CEO.
"Kinda feel bad for Tim. He can&#39;t be completely honest on interviews and he was not ready to talk about the magic mouse.<br><br>He could&#39;ve praised the iconic design, how well you use it as a mouse and a track pad allowing for so much control, but then, the first thing that came to mind was ergonooooomics 😂"
Tim is one of the few ceos who seem like such a genuinely good guy
Wow! Tim is lucky to be chatting with MKBHD
YOU DONT SIT AND SHAKE HANDS 🤝
You are absolutely insane if you think data privacy will be anything but a complete utter clusterfuck now.
Bud had &#39;talked tech&#39; with every ceo ever
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=242"">4:02</a> The Greatest Lie any big corporation can come up with."
“We don’t wanna be FIRST to do it ; we wanna be BEST to do it” TimCook
We&#39;re lucky Tim invented AI. The World is now saved.
"Tim straight up did not answer the question at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=180"">3:00</a>"
Right To Repair
Tim talked to all YouTubers to promote the AI but he decided to lock it to the 15 pro and pro max to deny millions and millions holding the regular 15 and below from pro and non pro models.
"You cannot conduct a serious interview with someone like Tim. No matter your questions, he will consistently praise the &quot;amazing&quot; Apple products and how &quot;incredible&quot; they are."
I always ask Vision Pro users what do they use it for😂
It&#39;s still cool to see my phone advice guy interviewing these massive figures
you should have pulled out an s24 ultra to read your notes off of. lol
the lighting in the faces are really bad
LET TIM COOOOOOK
I&#39;m captivated by the fact that Tim Cook talks like a young Mitch McConnell
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=331"">5:31</a> When MKBHD mentions its the 15 model to Tim. <br>😂.. they all look the same 😂"
Marques should link this twitch streamers page
iPhone &gt;&gt; all the other stuff combined
&quot;Getting the ergonomics correct on the Magic Mouse.&quot; Never laughed harder at a CEO&#39;s bullshit.
Nice to see Marques collaborating with a small Brand like Apple. <br><br>Doesn&#39;t marques have more followers than apple.
“Tim Apple in Da Hizouse”<br><br>-Donald Trump
Hey look! It&#39;s a cook for the team.
Just a little casual chat with Tim Apple. Wild to see how much this channel has grown over the years.
Ultimate flex with the Magic Mouse question. Even Tim was like &quot;shit bruh you got us&quot; lol
This needs to stop. They all will first starve us to death and then kill with this quest for ultimate AGI. Governments needs to intervene.
Tim is such a bad interviewee.
Tim sound like Sheldon
That Marques&#39;s smirk after Tim mentions ergonomics as a key point for magic mouse LOL 🤣
"are we all gonna skip over the way he compared apple’s devices to his kids, nephews, and nieces? like that’s gotta be one of the most dystopian parts"
"It&#39;s Tim Apple, who is this cook guy?"
I wish there had been a question about X banning iPhone bar of AI
lmao when MKBHD asked about the magic mouse 🤣🤣
Was the last part of this video paid sponsorship of vision pro
marques was using Samsung 24 Ultra in recent videos and for this one he brought his Iphone 15. He uses both but wondering if apple said he cant use any other competitive brands in the interview.
Nice questions Marques
Totally trolled him on the Magic Mouse. MKBHD been dogging that for years.
Anybody know the outro music?
"I cannot believe Mkbhd brought up the Magic Mouse Holi shit , WOW"
Marques rolling his eyes during the Magic Mouse bit was amazing.
"Gotta be honest, I feel like Marques was trying to remind Tim about the Magic Mouse. The smirk Marques had after asking was like &quot;when you gonna update it&quot; lol"
That was a great interview!
why am i bored with 1 min of mr tim speaking?
The Letter Triple U in WWDC
uhhhhh the magic mouse uhhhhhh
Let Tim Cook🗣🔥
wait a minute. is Tim responding to interview questions in the same tonal variation he uses when he makes the presentations? you know like the falling intonation they use when ending their product descriptons at Apple? like the sustained flair with which they pronounce words?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=868"">14:28</a> Most respectful roast"
I’ll always respect iPhone for privacy and I think they are leaps and bounds on competition on that
Bro is a real apple.boy
Tim:   Magic Mouse Ergonomics<br>MKBHD: “What you talkin &#39;bout Willis?”
Great job Marques !!!!!!!!
&quot;the magic mouse&quot;
hes kind of a boomer.
"Marques, not mentioning the lightning port to the CEO lmao"
The magic mouse 😂😂 i am sorry i can&#39;t 😂😂
"Chill Marques, let him Cook"
whos the guy on the right? great vid MKBHD!
Tough questions. I like it.
Tim ruined Marques plot to get him to rank the Magic Mouse above the Vision Pro
Here’s the proper ranking:<br>5. Magic Mouse<br>4. Vision Pro<br>3. iPad<br>2. MBA<br>1. iPhone
The look and zoom when Tim was talking about getting the ergonomics right for the Magic Mouse was a chef’s kiss on this video 😂
Tim cooked
"Why do People believe the shit that comes out these people&#39;s mouths..Ur data will b sold all over the world no matter what these companies tell u ,..wake up people don&#39;t b fooled ."
Did you two kiss afterwards? Looked like a date lol
"Dear Mr. Marques great interview...i just wonder how did you reach Mr. Tim becouse i tried manytime email i got from Google, but no one replied me...i have created Softwear battery project which never was invent world wide and i want to sell it to Apple company which am sure will blow many people mind with this new invention...please advice i live in Oman..."
"I think they respect, the power that you wield now. With great reach comes great responsibility!<br> Apple&#39;s next product transparent glass and invisible apps!"
A tech guru talking with Tim Cook 🙌🏼
‘Our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed’ I like that
"lets be honest apple had to catch up and couldnt do it themselves its not ready even iOS 18 wont have it all, gemini is better with help me write can make a whole email, not just re arrange it. apple only done it because others have, it shouldn&#39;t be a catch up thing"
imagine saying you care about privacy as the CEO of Apple after implementing AI and having NSA backdoors in Apple Silicon lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> Apple Magic Mouse getting the ergonomics well done? Clearly we still have work to do :)"
I’m rooting for Marques to be even more successful and the fact of Apple CEO giving him attention means He already accomplished it!
"Shocking, MBK’s usual snarky and low key hating on Apple is NOT on display here. Maybe he’s star struck hehe"
"I love Tim Cook :) if there had to be a ceo to represent such a huge corporation and a man to represent it, I would choose him"
So mkbhd probably cannot be too harsh on apple anymore.
tim cook looks and talks like a knock off bill gates
Let&#39;s this channel on top 🎩
Macig mouse ... Charging and using at the same time hahaha...
So was the video shot on the S24 Ultra or why are you holding an iPhone 😜
Well thanks to the ergonomics of the magic mouse I have avoided RSI by not using its horrible design
Craig Federighi for CEO after Tim Cook
"Nasdaq-state <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=70"">1:10</a>"
So glad MKBHD putting spotlight to small companies like Apple.
Didn&#39;t Marques do a critical review of the Magic Mouse? It would be &quot;groundbreaking&quot; if they moved the charge port to the back of the mouse.
"has marques sacrificed his entire relationship with apple for that one GLORIOUS moment? if so, it was WORTH IT"
"if ijustine look like she was talking to her uncle, this is MKBHD talking to his step uncle"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a> &quot;Ergonomics.....well..done...     MKPHD: ...with magic mouse..........okay...4/5 (smahing it into the wall)<br>LMFAO"
Just finished Tim is a robot fr
This One For The History Books 🎉❤ HKBHD x APPLE
This is why MKBHD will never do an objective Apple review :-)
Tim cook wear nike spec
The shade from that side eye when Tim mentioned the Magic Mouse ergonomics 🤣 you showed great restraint.
Marques wanted to laugh when Tim mentioned Ergonomics when talking about the Magic Mouse🤣
Quick question is it Ai or AI?
"Ergonomics of Magic mouse... Yyyeah. Yeah sure Tim. Other than that, lovely little interview. Gives a glimpse of insight as to how Apple approached and approaches AI. Pity he didn&#39;t play ball with the game. <br>iPhone 1, iPad 2, Macbook Air 3, Vision pro 4, Magic mouse 147."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=540"">9:00</a> Jobs made 1 from 0. That’s incredible. Cook has made 1 to TRILLIONS. That’s incredible also."
"I thought it was an interview in which a brilliant person like MKB put him under pressure for certain choices on AI and VIsor, but instead it was a promotion"
"I was wondering if, were Steve Jobs alive, Marc would probably be interviewing him. It would be awesome."
"This feels like a job interview, where tim is lying to get a job and we all see it"
Tim saying AI...daamnn thats weird and awesome at the same time!?😂😮‍💨
BRO TRYING SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH AT THE MAGIC MOUSE 😭😭😂
No Samsung phone in this interview. 😊
I thought I was late to the vid but here I realize it went up today.
"Man said, &quot;getting the ergonomics well done&quot;, when referring to the Magic Mouse. What a joke!"
Tim speaks like ChatGPT asked to do paid advertisement.
"Hey Marques, out of subject. Is your team planning to make your merch more accessible to people in Canada? I’m conscient that this is not a big market… But i’m pretty sure that I’m not the only one that would buy multiples items if it was a bit less expensive!<br><br>For example, your hoodie is incredibly nice but with conversion and shipping it cost more than a 105$ for a single piece ☹️<br><br>We love you a lot in Canada 🇨🇦 !"
Whenever I see this guy all I can think of is the Ricky Gervais &quot;sweat shops in China&quot; comment 😆
"honestly, tim sounds old!"
Look at marques face when he said ergonomics of the Magic Mouse is priceless - bro face is saying you being serious right now.
The Magic Mouse!!🤣🤣 and the look in his eyes
Tim Cook annoys me so much he doesn’t care about technology he only cares about his bank accounts. Steve Jobs appointed him CEO quickly because Steve was dying of cancer and was thinking clearly
Anyone else noticed how Tim is really good at talking without saying anything?
"The fact that Marques started calling AI, just Intelligence is proof of how powerful Apple branding is.<br><br>Absolutely crazy!"
Oh man the ranking part you got Tim🤣🤣
There is no way he uses the magic mouse or the apple vision pro.<br><br>No way
"Tim is real good at saying nothing, committing to nothing, and obfuscating any level of absolute and definitive clarity. the man can not in anyway, shape, or form be decisive externally until all his ducks are in a row. every base is covered, and has been focus tested, and he has all the vantage points covered. ffs."
The look or Marcus’s face when Tim said Ergonomics 😂😂
Marques is so shady saying AI ten times in the first sentence and then bringing up the Magic Mouse lol
Elon and Tim are polar opposites
it&#39;s crazy how close this was to iJustines interview in terms of Tim&#39;s answers
Even Marques doesn’t have the balls to be reading the questions off his Pixel…😜
Tim Apple 😂
“Not the first but the best”🤝🏽
We got MKBHD and Tim collab before GTA VI 🔥
HELLO MKBHD AND STEVE JOBS
Crazy
They need a new CEO man!! About time!!
"I costantly believe that Tim is a Robot used only for events, even here he talks like this and doesnt give an answer."
The magic mouse part was BOLDDD to mention😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=705"">11:45</a> our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be best"
😍
"I love the MacBook Pro laptop. But let’s be honest, Magic Mouse is probably the worst product Apple has ever made, the fact that you can’t charge the mouse if you are using it’s insane, please remove it from the market and create something decent"
i cringed when he said the magic mouse was ergonomic
Why didn’t you ask about ipad?! That should have been the first question
I thought he was interviewing Biden. The reaction speed was like an 60hz iPhone in 2024.😑😑😑
Marques  is skilled at asking questions and tim at answering
Tim Cook is underrated. So is MKB.
Marques said: And now we have WWDC.  Bro WWDC has been around long before iPhone.
"What he really meant at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=535"">8:55</a>  was... &quot;Yeah Marques I really don&#39;t want to talk about that&quot;"
*Tim Apple
This Tim guy sounds like he has a good idea
The CEO of the worlds most valuable Trillion dollar company is out here chilling in some Nike&#39;s and a fun and quirky pair of socks👟 The future is guaranteed to be wild 🤪
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=130"">2:10</a> shareholders, no shade, but thats probably the reason lmao"
Always great to talk with the main man. congrats Tim
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=857"">14:17</a> so I’m guessing Tim’s least favorite is the Vision Pro. If he doesn’t use it for productivity purposes, then that tells me that it’s an unfinished product."
Salute to my man MKBHD❤
MKBHD is my guy!! Talks to everybody like one of the homies 💯
God i hate apple..
Magic mouse 😂
"Oh no, The Brownlee is getting too powerful, we must slow down his influence!"
the sarcastic “of the magic mouse?” after the ergonomics statement 😂
"you all know it&#39;s gonna be boring, and it is boring af"
The magic mouse scene got me cringing 😫😫
Can I get a wwdc bottle
"Cook hope you reading this, your mise is horrible, its anti ergonomic, in every sense of the word"
16 minutes only if sad😭😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=648"">10:48</a> I recall that moment in history,  It blew my mind."
Did expect to see Tim Apple with marquez
Tim mentioned &quot;ergonomics&quot; about the Magic Mouse<br><br>MKBHD: <b>Speed laugh</b>
Marques face when he said &quot;With the magic mouse while nodding his head..... Okay😂😂😂
LET TIM COOK🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
❤
Marques&#39; face says what we&#39;re all thinking about the &quot;Magic&quot; mouse.
The magic mouse  <br>Yeah <br>Ok😂😂😂
Great interview!!!
Tim Cook&#39;s comment on his legacy… i love it.
Marquees threw Tim a curve ball with Magic Mouse. Tim will never say anything bad about any Apple Product. So Ergonomics was the only good thing he could think of. Of course there are much better.  Tim Cook is one of those rare CEOs that has a deep understanding of what his company does and embodies the company’s values.
"God, I miss Steve Jobs. So uninspiring to hear such an impactuful company&#39;s CEO giving pure corporate generic careful answers. Can&#39;t feel it."
The magic mouse moment 😆
Tim would be a great politician
Tim: Yearhh 💅💁‍♀️
You totally missed the empathy bro.
Magic Mouse 😅
"And One more thing, Tim screen time still doesn’t work for TikTok can you fix it please?"
Such a boring person to interview
So glad tim is discussing to talk mkbhd

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> hahaha very funny 😅"
Adobe must learn a lot  from Apple about privacy
These were actually some really tough questions you have to respect this man and his integrity and dedication to his community
Airport WiFi router predated MacBook Air…?
The way Marques tried to set up Tim Cook will go down in history 😭😭😭
And all this with a serious face! To believe
I don&#39;t think Tim understood the blind ranking game 😂
We got Tim Cook interview before GTA 999999999999999999999999
MKBHD IS A 🐐
I love how the chapters still say &quot;Blind Ranking&quot; when Mr. Cook clearly doesn&#39;t play the game.
Tim talked about the vision pro like someone who&#39;s never used it before
You got him with the Magic Mouse 😆
blud didn’t rate a single product 😭😭
The only Tim Cook interview I care about
Cook - 👎🏻 🤮
Big step for Marques! Tim is the man.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=770"">12:50</a> MKBHQ died inside. 😂"
"Say what you will, this was your first and last interview with him, he&#39;s never letting you do that again to him."
Tim cook got cooked with &quot;ergonomics&quot; ingredient.
"I thought that you will ask him, about the iPhones that supposed to be compatible with the Apple Intelligence but don’t and what’s the real reason about that ! Apart from that great interview MKBHD, i loved it !"
&quot;Our goal is never to be first it&#39;s to be best&quot; lol At least they know they just copy other people&#39;s ideas and charge more for them.
A collav that we never expected🔥🔥
Fun fact: double tap a comment to like
These are Apple’s best answers they’ve ever made
🙏Since Tim will watch this interview please ask him to invest more in education now too such as the  “app book”  no update for the past 5 years and to bring back the tunvesity app where people can learn free courses.
Bro did NOT blind rank anything
Did he say it never send stuff to the cloud lol does all the time as iphones run out of space
"Ergonomics 😂😂 &amp; when did he ran anything he just said everything is amazing u should have ask magic cloth he will b like it was so amazing moment for the ergonomics and innovation to keep everything Press new shiny no fingerprints, the ultimate tool for all Apple products highest ranking"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a> marques trying not to laugh was funny asf"
he didnt answer your questions. I hate this way of speech.
&#39;Iphone 15 yeah..&#39;😅
I am your big fan ❤❤
"Apple should make a mirrorless camera with ios style menus that integrates with iphone, ipad and mac 🤔"
The Magic Mouse is ergonomic if you don’t grab it the way you grab a normal mouse. You’re supposed to just lay your hand on it like a pad. Most ppl don’t understand that tho so they grab it with their fingertips and that’s why it’s uncomfortable. It’s simply a mismatch with how ppl think it should work and how it actually works. Now obviously they dropped the ball bcuz it’s on the them to anticipate how ppl will hold something so they just missed the mark.
😂 the look on Marques’ face when Tim says they really had to get the ergonomics right with the Magic Mouse. 😆
Great interview Marques. My only criticism is that you have a ton to say in your reviews about things you don&#39;t like how &amp; when Apple did it and you didn&#39;t take your top 5 or top 2 and asked the man. You talk a big talk but you could politely and effectively walk the walk if you wanted to...
How awkward was that magic mouse question
Tim Apple
the &quot;ww&quot; being misspelled as &quot;wv&quot;  (or &quot;vw&quot;) is driving me crazy
Marques should have really brought his S24 Ultra along to this interview.
Marques trying not to laugh when he’s talking about the Magic Mouse😂
Tim taks only with women and black.
Please iPhone x not iOS 18😢
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a>  <br>Apple mouse &amp; ergonomics<br>Those words dont seem related."
kudos to the camera guy for the absolute focus on Marques during magic mouse || ergonomics
Nice video😎
Bro is that an iPhone you got there? Don&#39;t you daily the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra?
MKBHD actually did Apple&#39;s last review using a a SAMSUNG and I felt he was not very enthusiastic about it . I&#39;m happy to see that Tim got wind of that has offered an interview in return. Cool.
The CEO of a trillion dollar company has to be very careful with their words but the interview just didn’t  feel as genuine as your interview with Elon or Bill.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a> MKBHD “magic mouse, ergonomics. Seriously?” 😂"
glad they let you shoot on the REDs and not the iPhones
Tim Cook is a very nice person and a great leader. He took apple to next level. Loved this interview.
Let me help Tim with the rankings:<br>iPhone - 1<br>Vision Pro- 2<br>iPad -3<br>MacBook Air - 4<br>Magic Mouse - 5
"Tim should feel very thrilled to talk with MKBHD, it should be one of his biggest career achievements. Well done Tim I am so happy for you!"
Marques trying not to laugh when he’s talking about the Magic Mouse😂
Magic mouse moment was golden 😂😂
Wow giving old Timmy a chance to cook
what happens if you cry while wearing the vision pro
Lmao he know damn well the Magic Mouse is trash
Happy pride month to Tim!
Okay lowkey mkbhd is the most respected tech reviewer of all time
That edit when Tim Cook speaks about “ergonomics” and “magic mouse” 🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=331"">5:31</a> 😂😂"
who noticed mkbhd just switched his s24 ultra to 15 pro for just this video😂
The Magic Mouse part was clearly Magic!
The way he says &#39;lives&#39;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> lmao he thought it was android"
"I know you tried your best but Tim is like a record stuck on repeat, always the same answers. Luckily you’ve been able to get more out of other Apple execs."
"we need more MKBHD interviews, this was fantastic even though he didn&#39;t really answer anything"
Tim literally took the question Marques gave him and turned it into a soliloquy. Like bro you do know he asked you question not just some random thought lol
Is there a way to turn off AI?
Asking the CEO to blindly rank their products is insanneee😭 you need a lot of influence to even do that lmfao
Great interview. God damn dude. Keep this up.
he did Not know what a blind ranking was 😭
"From all those great CEOs - Jensen, Musk, Nadella, Pinchar, others Cook actually thinks how to answer each question - he ponders and then formulates sentences, whereas others often respond too quickly as if they have &quot;standard&quot; replies. 10/10 Tim Cook and good luck Apple in AI era."
Hearing Tim say he lost his parents was so heart breaking.
Huge thanks to Marquez for spending the time for apple.
Only Marques Brownlee.. He’s probably the most powerful person in Tech right now now.
"You always need to talks about Ai only with ceo From Google, go away from apple they are nothing with they bad ai😂"
It was an honor for Tim to meet you.
Tim Cook got the change to talk with MKPHD
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> Marques trying to hold his laugh hearing ergonomics😂"
Marques hid the Google pixel😂😂😂
Magic Mouse moment bout to become a meme
idk if I&#39;m tripping or is this unintentional asmr?
Cant wait to see how Apple will implement Alibaba Intelligence into their products!
Surprised he’s not rocking a Samsung 😅🤣
The game was fun he really committed to ranking them
Imagine having someone as smart and measured as MKHB on the ballot this november instead of the geriatric duo... Would be such an easy decision.
BS
As a blind person I just realised that a Vision Pro plus something like Be My Eyes would be absolutely incredible❤
"This is a surprisingly little known fact, Tim Cook is gay. One of the very few CEOs that are, actually. Happy pride month."
who let tim cook 😴🗣️
Let him cook
Wish he asked why the base iphone still has 60hz refresh rate and usb 2.0 speeds and fast charge. And why the ipad pro isn&#39;t really pro.
Magic Mouse was a good one. Magic Mouse is horrible. Every Mac I have uses a Logitech mouse. It is beautiful to look at but not to use for more than 10 minutes. I really wish they would make a Logitech shaped mouse with Apple materials. No need for anything fancy.
Glad to hear from Tim “let him” Cook on his thoughts on the benefits.
Apple sucks
I’m surprised MKBHD didn’t burst out laughing when he said “ergonomic” and Magic Mouse in the same sentence 💀
"The Magic Mouse ergonomics 😅. Well, that just kills are prospect of an actual ergonomic Magic Mouse 😢"
Apple on top 🔥
lol how many of you are just going to make the exact same joke as the top comment???
Tim is cooking!
All he had to do was blindly rank five Apple products. Instead he tried to glaze the Magic Mouse 😂
Why not ask to change things like repairability or cost or iMessage bubbles or same design in iphones or not giving enough to ipads to overcome the macs
"Before long, they&#39;ll ditch ChatGPT because, knowing Apple, which likes to control every detail of iOS, they will likely develop their own AI-centric OS called Apple Intelligence OS. Haha."
Oh God Tim Looks so cute when he is molten😅
Sneaky Marques
Lets go! Congratulations! ❤ (37 minutes ago!)
The change to &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; is because the market wants it! Microsoft and Nvidia have marketed it successfully.
At this rate MKBHD is gonna talk to everyone including Jesus Christ himself.
Wow
110K views in 37 minutes! Wow!
Dude it’s so annoying that he won’t play along and have some fun with the bind ranking.
Lol the power MKBHD holds over the tech community is insane
Missed the opportunity to ask about the magic mouse charger
1 - iPhone<br>2 - MacBook Air<br>3 - iPad<br>4 - Vision Pro<br>5 - Magic Mouse
magic mouse question was personal 💀
Tim Cook is 63....why do you want a 63 year old running your supposedly dynamic and world-class innovative tech co?<br>like unless he&#39;s the founder of Apple (he&#39;s not) or has extraordinary vision (he doesn&#39;t) i don&#39;t see why they keep him around...
the passive aggressive of Marques when mentioning the magic mouse is insane lol. The slow zoom into his face and Tim kinda stumbled and all that 🤣
Watch The Boys or Gen V and then watch any interview with a big company like this and tell me you don’t see the Vought-ness on display
"i understand tim as the ceo has to say every product was a big moment for the company, but using ‘ergonomics’ as the word for the magic mouse is CRAZY"
10 years ago you were reviewing beats by dre? How did this happen 🤣🤣🤣. You have come such a long way
MKBHD why you gave him a chance ?
The zoom in the magic mouse section killed me 😭😭
Perfect question : the magic mouse
"Steve Jobs was murdered by Tim Cook jk . I will say Tim Cook is destroying the purity of what Apple once was. Technology has failed us, gunshots by computer. I&#39;m ditching Apple and Samsung going with Elons new phones"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=175"">2:55</a> I like that Marques brings receipts when asking questions."
Tim getting Cook literally 😂
MKBHD is the Dseries event of Tim Cook era
Let him cook
Timothy &quot;No Charisma&quot; Cook. What a sad spectacle.
that cut to marquess’s face when tim said ergonomic magic mouse was gold🤣🤣🤣
Hello
The subtle zoom in during the magic mouse bit had me ded💀
Do you think he would have let you do the interview if you were wearing a Samsung watch and had you Samsung Ultra S24?
Tim is a criminal. And supports authoritarian regimes.
"Awesome, an interview with Tim Apple himself 👌"
I guess there was a NDA to NOT talk about iPadOS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
That magic mouse bit had me rolling oh my god
"Tim Cook, the best CEO in the world....if you like iterative changes."
MKHBD- “What do you rank the Mac Book?”<br>Tim- “Yes”
Wow Marques - getting one of the most powerful tech individuals on the planet to sit down with you for an interview is mind blowing.  Well done.
Early
"I was WHEEZING at the Magic Mouse section. Well done, Marques, especially with the editing as well."
Tim was thinking real hard on a complement for the Magic Mouse LOL
who let tim cook
This is why Marques on top of the food chain in the tech world….he always go over and beyond in interviews or making some type of tech videos.
it sucks how avoidant and vague he has to be about everything lol. can&#39;t even be honest about the magic mouse. i&#39;ve yet to see an interview with tim cook where i hear him say something interesting or unpredictable
Homie hates the mouse
"Nice to see Marques ask some real questions to Tim. Hopefully, he does this even more and really goes hard like Nilay from Verge. Marques really has the power to ask some really tough questions. Let&#39;s go man"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> lmao he thought it was an android at first 😂😂"
mkbhd is the GOAT! ...I laughed out loud when he mentioned the Magic Mouse 😂
It’s Tim Apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marques&#39;s reaction😂"
This feels like marques is job interviewing Tim Cook lol
যে ফলো দিবে সে ও ফলো পাবে 😊
Once Tim and Apple win over MKBHD... it&#39;s over for all of us. 😂😂
Putting your foot toward Tim was disrespectful.
Where are the difficult questions?
Apple doesnt like museums also Apple picture book exists and is $300
Great to see marques interviewing these up and comers!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=744"">12:24</a> THE MOST GANGSTER QUESTION IN TECH HISTORY. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Emmy worthy camera work during the scramble. TC should have done his homework. The Magic Mouse is the PT Cruiser of Apple. <br>MKBHD, let&#39;s hope TC doesn&#39;t throttle or brick your devices."
Great take with Tim….where is the head of Samsung at?
❤😂❤😂
ok ... switching to Linux it is 😂
thanks for coming (if you know what I mean...)
Why didn’t you ask some tough questions MKBHD
Good to see Marques doing some diversity interviews. Bright future for white males &amp; DEI.
“It was also an incredible moment” [About the Magic Mouse] <br><br>I’m an Apple Sheep but ain’t no way he just said that lmfao
Mkbhd switching to a 13pro not to offend Tim 😭
Not the ergonomics 😂
the mouse lol
Not a chance Tim Cook said &quot;ergonomics were key&quot; with magic mouse. There just is no shot
Wow Apple is finally listening to their customers. Nice one!
The magic mouse part 😂
"Tim played that game like Macs play games. Acknowledge they exist and have conversations about them, but rules and requirements are secondary. 😅"
What a boring ass interview
hahaha hilarious Magic Mouse
He like vision pro because of multiple window but ios still doesnt support multi window
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> Me trying not to laugh in class"
Bro had all 1 rankings
Next time can you ask him to bring back the headphone jack? 👀
You didnt ask why 8GB ram cost €250?
Would have been better to write down the questions/notes on your S24U...
MKBHD on apple payroll 😢<br><br>We&#39;re never ever going to see any apple critique from him.
MKBHD in the Champions League 🔥🏆. Winners circle ⭕️ 💫
"Steve Jobs was sincere in every single word he spoke during interviews. Tim is the absolute opposite of that, a boring PR talking mouth.😮‍💨"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=330"">05:30</a>  Marques was like yeah yeah its the latest you wont catch me sleeping."
bro should have flexed his s24 ultra
You say small cpu in phone can create all those things like photos and Google need mega servers 😂 everything is happening in phone omg what a scam😅
"very corporate responses by tim, as expected."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=735"">12:15</a> Ohh, this moment and Marques&#39; face preventing a giggle will go down in history!!!"
"I was lowkey expecting Marques to ask Tim Cook how fast he can type the alphabet, lol😅"
The Magic Mouse moment was insane 😂😂😂🧨
MKBHD&#39;s face when Tim Cook said &quot;ergonomics&quot; while talking about the Magic Mouse is priceless
He should be a politician the way he dodged the ranking question
Tim needs a retirement to yesterday
This video will break the internet.
Caught me off guard with this interview.
Wish we could have heard him answer some tough questions.
Man you made CEO of Apple nervous and speak stupid stuff🤣🤣
I guess Tim wanted some tips from MKpHD
So Tim got Cooked
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=19"">0:19</a> easy apple intelligence  😂😂😂"
😂😂😂 The magic mouse shows how Tim Cook is cooking us.😂😂😂<br><br>Ergonomic 😂😂😂
"Don’t know if MKBHD asked him this (I’m watching as I’m typing this), but did he ask Tim why Apple isn‘t implementing their own AI instead of using ChatGPT? I would be very interested in Tim‘s answer to this question."
wow!
unsubscribed right here.
marques got moves damn
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> you could almost see him laugh out."
We got Marques with Tim cook before GTA 6..... Damn
"&quot;You have the conscious decision to use ChatGPT&quot;  is equivalent to &quot;Your choice, Your risk&quot;."
"Neat that you got to interview Tim in person! I have to say, in contrast to Steve Jobs, I really do miss Apple having a visionary CEO, and it feels like Tim knows less about the company than Apple&#39;s fans. Either that, or his answers were very rehearsed to the point where &quot;playing it safe&quot; would be an understatement. I could tell Marques wasn&#39;t very impressed either, honestly."
tim chief executive officer for apples
MKBHD X TIM
"I mean, the idea of MKBHD interviewing Tim Cook is so cool but in reality this conversation felt so inauthentic and calculated. It was hard to watch."
Will Apple eventually offer Apple Intelligence  on iPhone SE or 15 or 14 too?
nah let Tim cook fr 😭💀
Very important topic. The people always said “android already know this for years” <br>Yes but Apple didn’t want to be the first one<br>They want the functions on the best one
Tim Cook and TechImma1st <br><br>Don&#39;t take my comments seriously. It&#39;s only a meme
"I’m hoping Tim comes away after the Magic Mouse question and say to his team, “Guys, we gotta fix this”"
Boring. So corporate and fake. Marques clearly afraaid to say what he really thinks. &quot;they really got the ergonomics right with the magic mouse&quot; yeah right
Under 1 hour gang 🔥🔥🔥
The fact that Tim is not using New Balance should be enough to make me angry….but maybe we can convince him
"This was kind of a wash. MKBHD has the clout to ask the tough questions without having to worry about backlash. I respect Tim, but you really gotta press the Apple C-suites to get direct answers out of them."
Good interview for sure but Tim’s getting old man
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=345"">5:45</a> That&#39;s a big claim noone can back 100%"
😳 Apple should hire MKBHD as a consultant. Or just hire me.
Bet Tim will never wash that hand again
Such a flex move from Tim to be interviewed by MKBHD ^^
Marques asked tough questions. I can see that Tim is aware of Apple’s Vision Pro &amp; Magic Mouse shortcomings. Makes me wonder why they’re not better.
The looks Marques was giving to Tim when he was talking about the magic mouse 😂
"I&#39;d like to see you ask the same questions to Craig and see what he has to say, I feel like he would have straight up put the magic mouse in last place"
I was expecting Marques to pull up a Galaxy S24 Ultra
"Apple has really dropped the ball. The latest event was weak but the biggest flaw was AI. Instead of pursuing the next revolution after the Industrial Revolution, they chased VisionOS. Now they are in last place with AI and are using OpenAI. Microsoft is using OpenAI to build tech for US intelligence agencies (FBI)."
Support the small creators mkbhd is very generous for this
“Getting the ergonomics well done was key” 😂😂😂
Imagine Tim Shaking hands with MKBHD
Those zoom-ins during the magic mouse was A+
MKBHD face when Tim talks about the Magic Mouse is sooo funny
Tim: … ergonomics.<br>MKBHD : for the magic mouse?<br>Tim: yeah<br>MKBHD: sure <br>Camera: zooms in on MKBHDs face<br>MKBHD: 🫥
best part gotta be the magic mouse segment
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=181"">3:01</a> Damn, MKBHD should have broken out his Android phone in front of Tim."
"Thats honestly really unfortunate that Tim wouldn&#39;t give straight answers and instead beat about the bush constantly, especially while talking about the Magic Mouse. You could see Marques biting his tounge in that moment. Why do all CEO&#39;s have to talk in such manipulative manner?"
Very interesting questions. Mkbhd style
That Magic Mouse moment was hilarious 🤣 &quot;ergonomics&quot; is definitely a word I wouldn&#39;t use to describe it
Loved the &quot;magic mouse&quot; curve ball.
Did he call you Marcus 😭
Thank you Tim Apple
You’re too socially awkward for interviews. The last couple I’ve seen have been very hard to watch. You don’t have to do this.
I guess this means we arent getting a magic mouse update then
mkbhd and timcook before GTA VI is WILD
"I don’t understand the point of interviewing Apple employees. They don’t tell you want you really want to know, they don’t commit to answering the questions…Pointless."
The &quot;we came up with so and so&quot; has me dying 💀
Tim has such a careful tongue. He&#39;s saying all the right things. Didn&#39;t even rank the Apple devices cause he probably knows someone will read too much into it. “Tim Cook sets Magic Mouse bottom of the list as Apple&#39;s worst creation”
He should sit with Henrik Fisker. 😂😂😂
Apple intentions is to bring AI for everyone ( I didn’t know every single apple user has a 15 pro )
Make more of these
MKBHD face when Tim says the magic mouse is ergonomic 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=416"">6:56</a> if you&#39;re looking at your phone more than you&#39;re looking at someone else&#39;s [eyes] something&#39;s off there<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=430"">7:10</a> I mean for us we&#39;ve never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices <br>                                                                                               our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed <br>                                                                       our model is one that where we want to empower you to to be able to do things <br>                                                                                                                                                       you couldn&#39;t do otherwise"
MB asking the real questions 👊
What about what Tim said about Apple’s model being not about building engagement but building things that allow you to do stuff you couldn’t do before? Is there some truth in that you think? Or just marketing?
"I think apple can no longer say that iPhone are built for future proofing and can be used for longer.<br>Literally every new feature gets restricted to the new iPhone only and all the other iPhone get is a wallpaper and couple of customization option.<br><br>Low budget android phone stop updating their phone after 2 year, but if you look at apple they are doing the same thing."
ergonomics with magic mouse is straight up crazy 💀
The true face of tech standard is MKBHD
The smug look on Marques’ face when Tim was talking about the Magic Mouse 😂
The difference betwen Marques’s and iJustine’s interview is so significant 😭😭
Marques: Rank these products.<br>Tim: Ok<br><b>goes into first product</b><br>Tim: you know what? nah
Omg the real Tim Apple
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=764"">12:44</a> he can&#39;t hide how bad the Magic Mouse is! lol"
Marques’ response when Tim called the Magic Mouse “ergonomic” 😂😂😂
Bro you did him bad at the &#39;magic mouse&#39; moment.
Look at you. You are friends now ❤
There&#39;s something wrong with the Thumbnail of this video. I am not exactly sure what!!
The GOAT button———^
"well, see, we wanted to thoughtfully remove artists and creatives out of their jobs, but let me just pivot to privacy without answering the question about generative ai."
WHO LET TIM COOK
No way he said ergonomics
HAHA! The Magic Mouse question made me laugh out loud!!! It was truly a magic moment…🤭
Bro used the ultimate weapon &quot;privacy&quot; to answer every question
getting the.... ergonomics well done... was key
"seeing Marques&#39; reaction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> when Tim mentioned the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse was priceless"
Where is the S24U though? Did Tim say &quot;enough is enough. Wanna interview me you better not flash a S24U in my face&quot;?
"This is great, though I would love to see a more personal interview with Tim and Marques."
"Tim is so limited in what he can say because he&#39;s the face of a trillion dollar company that stuff like this is just plain boring. You hear from him exactly what you would expect. ChatGPT could have generated all his responses and no one would have noticed. He definitely has his own opinions and weird takes, but it&#39;s all buried under a lot of PR training. I&#39;m giving this video a dislike; not because it was badly produced or thought through, but because this type of content is a miss in my opinion."
Nice to see that mkbhd also thinks for such small creator career😅and interview them so they can grow
For a min i thought  he would say apple&#39;s  intelligent
youre craaaazy bro
Slower than turtle ... turtle tim
Probably Steve Job would be more understandable than Tim on this conversation.
XD
That&#39;s a great interview! Congrats MKBHD and team!
"Tim don&#39;t have a good answers to convince regular customers to buy Vision pro, they work very hard on the hardware and the software to the point that they forget to ask them selves why people would buy it?"
"Awesome interview, and that look during the magic mouse moment 😅 Tim is moving up in the world for sure!"
Hello MKHD
magic mouse was tricky
AI is the hottest tech right now.
Cool! 🌐
Tim must be spending half of his time on media training to be able to talk about the mouse that well…
my blind ranking:<br>1. iPhone<br>2. Macbook Air<br>3. Vision Pro<br>4. iPad<br>5. Magic Mouse
Does tim cook have parkinsons?
Apple is redefining AI
You finally got Tim to say AI
Your undertone reaction to the Apple Mouse section says it all!
❤
it was so funny seeing the video and a samsung ad pops up
“The Magic Mouse…uhhhhh…ummm….getting the….uhhhhh….hmm…getting the ergonomics”🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=743"">12:23</a> marques trying his best to not laugh 😂. <br><br>Great video tho bro"
Magic Mouse moments was really funny. I understood Marques… i understood at your face your frustration about the lightning port… 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> &quot;Yeah, I know&quot; 😂 Tim was like: &quot;Bro, who are you talking with!?&quot;"
magic mouse is GOATED
"Well done 👏🏻 MKBHD ,, you have discussed what we want most ❤"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> 😂😂😂😂"
Mentioning ergonomics as a selling point about the Magic Mouse is hilarious
"damn, little disappointed we didn&#39;t get the blind ranking, but great interview overall!"
The ergonomics of the Magic Mouse? Bruh
&quot;...with magic mouse. kay.&quot;
I totally understand what Marques is talking about and no clue what Tim is saying at all.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> HE HAS TO BE JOKING 💀💀💀"
"Such strong questions, mkbhd definitely not a loser. Awesome questions"
"Did I just heard, Apple Magic mouse and Ergonomics in a single sentence 👀"
"magic mouse and ergonomics, uff!"
So happy that half of the fortune 100 are buying Visions pros.
He really struggled with the magic mouse and vision pro for a second before he found his safe marketing answer
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> the face MKBHD makes when Tim puts &quot;magic mouse&quot; and &quot;ergonomic&quot; in the same sentence 💀"
"Why does Tim appear to be a ultra-rich, out-of-touch, “PR-trained,” and inauthentic person more than usual?"
dude said magic mouse had the best ergonomics...lmao what
Tim Cook was cooking up a justification for the &#39;magic&#39; mouse XD
"Why can&#39;t you, if you have the money buy this server or servers to make it Personal Private Cloud compute"
Bro absolutely does not like the Magic Mouse 😂😂
Wish you got a chance to ask about his sneakers lol
Tim is a classic act in media training.
I can tell ergonomics was a big focus for the Magic Mouse 👍🙄
I like how Tim just decided to not to rate the products like marques asked
"When you mention about Magic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=740"">12:20</a> I was expecting answer similar to Calculator App upgrade future Upgrade in Magic Mouse"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> even Tim couldn’t guess which iPhone is which 😅"
Mr. Garrison and MKBHD in the same room is wild!
The Magic Mouse part was hilarious. He worded himself so carefully
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=387"">6:27</a> - “you decide” interesting 😅"
Was looking forward to this and now it’s here !!!<br><br>Let’s go !
Probably the worst interviewer ... Ok
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> 😂"
That zoom during magic mouse😂😂
You a Apple fan boy I watch your video but u never say bad things about Apple products or Apple as a company u must get paid by Apple or u on there payroll
Try to keep a straight face while talking about the Magic Mouse Marques 😂😂
Marques asks about the magic mouse and Tim decides to praise the &quot;ergonomics&quot; 😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=464"">7:44</a> Why is he talking as if Apple &#39;invented&#39; the screen time feature on smartphones? 😭"
"Asking Tim Cook about the Magic Mouse, Marques knew what he was doing 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> His face says it all &quot;Ergonomics!?&quot; 😂"
Its lowkey funny that even in the interviews Tim Cook sticks to his signature hand gestures😭
Best Collab it will helpful for the new developing technologies to improve their products
"Legends, passionate about their work."
"When Tim refuses to blind rank the products by saying the cheapest line in history &quot;I will fail miserably to rank them&quot;, I would have walked away from the interview. I hate when CEO&#39;s go scaredy cat mode. Grow a pair Tim."
"I love how marquess questioned the name of Apple Intelligence.<br>Everybody laugh and reacts to that, but when in front of Tim Cook, just marques dare to ask that thing."
"I really like Tim to me as a person and ceo he’s extremely good. While post-Jobs apple gets a lot of criticism many fairly it still to me suffers for the couple years where the company truly seemed lost. The naming, product’s etc. Now for some time i feel like the company are moving forward exceptionally well. Apple silicon, Macs, Iphones, AI are all top top notch, the company is again at the very top.<br><br>Still Tim is just not charismatic enough to be the public leader to me. Ofc this doesn’t matter as that is a less important aspect of a company but still i do miss that aspect of apple which craig does try to fill. <br><br>In regards to the new ceo i assume craig will be it. He seems to be groomed for the position vert clearly especially as most of the “old guard” don’t seem to appear as much as him"
Did you ask Tim if he was ok with bringing up the infamous Magic Mouse 😳
Tim seems tired
Excellent Questions
I bet Tim was happy to talk with Marpues Brownlee
"Yo, that&#39;s so cool! Tim is a lucky dude to chat with MKBHD 🤙🏼"
Is it me or Tim Apple side stepped the privacy question
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Will the improved Siri stuff come to non Pro models too? What about homepod mini?
not much of a blind ranking if you don&#39;t let the guy rank
I’m so proud of you bro
How Tim kept a straight face with the magic mouse question was hilarious. Props to Marques for that one
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=134"">2:14</a> I like his explanation here. Because it&#39;s true that the average consumer doesn&#39;t care about the technology that&#39;s powering a certain feature, they only care about the feature. Saying something uses AI, just so you can get the buzzword in, means nothing if the actual device or feature is garbage."
why marques looking at tim apple in the thumbnail like 😏😏😏
Tim can guarantee there will never be any data sent to open AI without our consent? Hope that statement ages well😂
Lol at the Magic Mouse bit. 😂 Tim’s like “shhhhhh”. 😂
Let him Cook
Glad MKBHD asked some meaningful questions. I didn’t understand the point of supersaf’s interview with Tim just basically asking him what devices he’s currently using.
"the question about the legacy of the magic mouse was hilarious, Marques was trying hard to keep a straight face"
&quot;It was an incredible moment&quot; <br>👁️👄👁️ UHHHHHHH
"Tim, could you do something, anything, about Siri?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> about the mouse, as he looking up away from the moderator and took time to respond about the mouse, you know he didn&#39;t believe in a single word of what he said."
that ergonomic&#39;s magic mouse question was personal (MK literally made a short calling it an &quot;ergonomic nightmare&quot;)
So what phone did Marques has on the couch here?
I don’t think he knows anything …
Magic Mouse part got me dead 💀 does he even know what is ergonomics?
Don&#39;t be afraid Marques ... But I guess it might be mercy as well for Tim
What an honorable moment to behold. Discussing and clearing up Apple&#39;s intent towards AI with the two big men themselves. Beautiful!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marques fighting for his life trying not to die laughing got me dead I love it<br><br>Edit: hi mom I&#39;m famous"
Why does it feel like TIM is more nervous than Marques….
He talks kinda like an ai tasked to make apple look as good as possible
The magic mouse part was so cheeky!
🍏 is really making sure they stay on top of the tech world 🌍 this is truly incredible
"Prehistoric human taking care of apple, crazy"
"Marques, I get it, it&#39;s tough to be critical, you probably don&#39;t want this to be the last interview with him, but I see so many missed opportunities in here, for instance:<br>- iPad has so little software that really demands its power, software isn&#39;t professional enough yet, what would be his take on this?<br>- Magic Mouse ergonomic? What about the people in pain after using it for 2 hours? Is Tim using the Magic Mouse?<br>- Side-Loading and how it was done by Apple where some or most would argue it&#39;s anti competitive."
"If anyone had any doubts if this was scripted or not, the Magic Mouse segment should remove them lol. The mental gymnastics and panic Tim went through to talk positively about the Magic Mouse is incredible. And props to Marques for zooming in dramatically 😂"
Tim forgot to say uhhh a few more times
Can’t believe marques actually threw in a magic mouse between those great products lol
Tim on waveform?
Marques Really Cook With This Interview With Of course Tim
@mkbhd I saw what you did there on the Magic Mouse Question. Ergonomically?? Nahhhh I don&#39;t think so.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a> magic mouse ergonomics 👁️👄👁️????"
this interview is gonna boost that Tim guys company a lot! mark my words!
Laughing so hard at Magic Mouse 😂😂
"You’re never too old to achieve great things, look at Tim getting the chance to talk to MKPHD!"
ergonomics of the Magic Mouse lol? that was a good one
The magic mouse cap
Maques let’s go back to 20syl intro
Marques checking Tim was still talking about the Magic Mouse when mentioning ergonomics is pretty funny 😂
Huge LOL at his reaction to the magic mouse. Yeah.... You shouldve asked him how it feels to flip it upside down to charge it when he&#39;s busy at work but runs low.
Marques&#39; face when Tim uttered the word &quot;ergonomics&quot; followed by Marques asking &quot;with the magic mouse?&quot;. Can&#39;t buy that moment.
i think Tim is the right Person to lead Apple
Ergonomics and magic mouse in the same sentence almost lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what is the microwave sound in the background?
Thx Tim Cook for not playing the game ... Haha
Tim should be honoured
"Great interview- I can definitely see a development in your interview style, and asking more challenging/direct questions. I do think there is still room for improvement though, for example, at the end when ranking the products, there was probably an opportunity to push a bit harder. The real skill with these interviews should be to get the CEO speaking honestly, and not as some corporate bot. There is a reason when Tim was in the UK he chose to do an interview with Dua Lipa and not Emily Maitlis.... Nilay Patel is currently the best at this in the YT tech community. Just my thoughts."
"The mqgic mouse moment, in can see the struggle in  Marquess&#39;s eyes. The laugh was HELD"
Tim reminds me of the Pale Man
"You can see how nervous Time Cook is, not very rehearsed upon the AI topic, he doesn&#39;t want to say that these new changes come as also a lot of market pressure.😂"
Magic Mouse 😅
How much ego &amp; arrogance of Apple to take all the AI credit.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=769"">12:49</a><br>Marcques&#39; honest reaction when Tim said &quot;getting the ergonomics of the magic mouse right&quot;"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> The cut to Marques&#39;s face got me rolling"
Nice 16 min Apple Ad 😂
Marquees’s “with the magic mouse?” Question is hilarious 😂
😂😂 <br>I see what you did there 😂😂 <br>Magic Mouse
must be very exciting for tim to meet someone like marques
BUY YOUR MOM AN IPHONE!!!
"Hello Marquez,, wonderful interview with Tim Cook. I was just wondering if you could somehow get to him and ask why the biggest Apple Keynote ever had no minority presenters? Lots of presenters on stage not one single black person. We were glaringly missing I really wish I knew why!"
I’ve lost a lot of faith in Apple since Tim took charge. The hardware is fantastic. The software is so far behind.
A couple years ago apples marketing team made fun of YouTubers <br>Now they have no choice YouTubers are at the center of marketing tech<br><br>50% of tech salls of smart watches for example are directly because of watching YouTube reviews of famous Smart watches
Why only iphone 15 pro and Pro Max?<br>If computational power is the limitation then why don’t other iphones are allowed to use cloud?
The editing on the magic mouse part speaks volumes
Lol I got a Pixel ad at the end of
Awesome interview!
Nvidia has overgrown Apple. What makes you think Tim Cook interests me when it comes to AI? Apple is long gone...
lol the magic mouse is the worst apple product of all time for me.
Let’s not get it twisted Tim needed this interview more than Marques….S/O to Marques for keeping it real with Tim
TECHNICAL AND ROBOTIC
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marques desperately trying to keep straight face so Apple would invite him to the interviews again"
Two gays talking
That awkward zoom when Tim talks about ergonomics in the magic mouse💀💀
"How genius, they made sure to hide Marques’ shoes out of the frame and had Tim cross his legs to show the sponsored shoes!"
Passion.  Hard work.  Joy in your work.  This is why Marques Brownlee has been a success and gets the great interviews.  Well done.
When i see this I can see sometimes MKBHD is not satisfied with the answer Tim gives sometimes. MKBHD Feels like man this is not the answer i want and then he Sighs off pretty much. This is a hot take. I can feel the same here. Tim ain&#39;t giving the full context of questions given by Our tech guy. Sadge 💀
"I&#39;m so jealous, i wish i could sit down and have a conversation with Marques."
Your face when he mentioned ergonomics of the Magic Mouse was mine too😂😂😂😂
Magic mouse and the ergonomics 🤯🤯🤯😳😳😳
Another title: Tim Cook just joking about things for 16 minutes 😅
This interview is way better than someone who gets &quot;so excited&quot; for every apple product.
He&#39;s probably ai genarated
Marques&#39; face when Tim Cook described the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse 😂
Does ai mean Apple Intelligance
Blind ranking without actually ranking...
Marques’s face when he talked about “ergonomics” of the Magic Mouse LMAOO 💀💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a> magic mouse ergonomics are well done.. 😂😂 Marques just let that sink in.."
&quot;put a lot of wood behind that arrow....&quot; never heard that saying before. i like it
Great interview!
I love that little smirk when Tim said that the magic mouse is ergonomic! 🤣🤣
"we learned nothing, all of those are PR answer , what&#39;s the point of face to face conversations when you can&#39;t answer without thinking of PR"
Tim had been cooked in this interview ❤😂
@mkbhd Thank you for bringing up the magic mouse and embarassing Tim
Alternate Title: Tim Cook lying straight for 16 minutes
Apple first mentioned AI in 2007 when they announced the iPhone keyboard - They’re probably one of the first companies to use it
No way!
"I didn’t really care about AI features, but what they went over in WWDC actually sounds pretty interesting and has peaked my interest."
Marketing brand name gimmicks.
I too would like to learn how to answer a question without answering the question
"No Apple Intelligence, No Apple News, No Apple Cash, No satellite sms… BUT here, in Europe, we pay too (sometimes more) 😤😡"
The close up on marquees after he said <i>the Magic Mouse</i>  reminds me of those times and places where you try hard to hold the laughter but it beets you eventually. <br>Mkbhd hold pretty good tho
Amazing how much noise can come out of his mouth without saying anything.
"I Always dislike interviews with apple ceos, they are exactly like the us politicians, words come out their mouths but they say nothing"
When world&#39;s top tech content creator meats world&#39;s most valuable company&#39;s CEO <br>Happy to see at this level marques
"every moment is &quot;incredible 😍🤩&quot; at Apple, like it&#39;s Narnia 🙄"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> 😅"
The interview was only 16 mins cause MKBHD has a tight schedule.
"LMAO, Marques&#39; face when Tim was talking about getting the ergonomics of the magic mouse 😭"
MKBHD took iPhone 15 for the interview.😆
I thought Marques was gonna pull out S24 in front of Tim Cook. Disappointed
way to go tim colloborating with biggest tech channel is quite an aceivement
"This interview took up aprox $5,398 of Tim&#39;s time"
So nice of MKBHD accepting an interview with Tim<br><br>OH HELLL YEAHHH
I have a feeling Tim secretly knows the magic mouse sucks lol. At least he knows all the hate with it. He struggled!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> never has a slow zoom in been able to silently convey so much...."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> pricless moment 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a> Marques trying not to laugh 🤣"
"Glad that Marques didn’t crack up at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=747"">12:27</a> because I sure did! 😂😂🤣🤣"
The face MKBHD makes when Tim says ergonomic&#39;s for the Magic Mouse is priceless
anybody who saw Marques forehead color?
Privacy ... Snowden leaks suggest something different.
Editing around the Magic Mouse bit was pure comedy
Who let him cook?
MKBHD helping out Tim Cook is something we all admire
Those were some great questions!
the zoom-in into tim and marques&#39; face when they spoke about the magic mouse is so meme worthy
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=741"">12:21</a> he couldn’t say not so good"
let him cook
"After all he critiques apple products this tells me that what really matters is being relevant. The fact that tim would sit down with him, that being said, kudos to marques"
Marques last video he was using Samsung<br><br>But now he is using the iPhone 😂<br><br>If not he used it Tim will be 🗿🗿💀💀💀cooked
"I mean... I just get more sure, that I&#39;ll never ever buy anything from apple by this interview."
Is good to see like ceo of apple gets opportunity to talk with marqus
WWDC24 seemed more like software update than hardware updates.
Whats up with Marquess (Editors) using Logic songs in the intro? I dig it
😂 Marques’s face when Tim tried to say the magic mouse was ergonomic
Seen quite a few YouTubers have these chats with Tim over the past day or so but this is the best. Most didn’t challenge or question the Data Privacy element being deployed by Apple which is key really for me deciding whether I’ll use this or not when it comes out<br><br>Glad MKBHD asked the right questions around data privacy. Tis appreciated<br><br>Still I think we need to get a deep dive on all this regarding Apple and Microsoft concerning AI Data Protection when all this goes live
"Wait, he just didn&#39;t do the ranking"
I swear Tim said uhhh at least 100 times
"MKBHD Seemed so shy. Good interview, awkward ending."
Tim now thinking about that Magic Mouse and where it would rank among the others. Perhaps we will see a New Magic Mouse before Tim retires.
i cant believe you mentioned the magic mouse LMAO
That magic mouse moment 😂😂😂
Good for MKBHD to take time out of his day to talk to Tim Apple
Tim is a marketing guy without a doubt lol
"MKBHD a man of the people, giving small creators a chance to have an audience"
TC is so PC. Can’t even give a rank. Very different from the Elon interview.
I didnt expect the magic mouse when MKBHD said it I was SO CURIOUS about Tim reaction best moment I would say.
"Crazy, bro got connections with everyone elite in the tech world"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=737"">12:17</a> He really tried his hardest to find something positive to say about the magic mouse 🤣"
MKBHD give me an iphone
You should&#39;ve used a pixel phone for that interview !!
The camera cuts and framing on the Magic Mouse ranking were nothing short of exquisite.
"The first 2 minutes of the video reminds me of the words doctor Mike said in their collaboration podcast along with mkbhd, &quot;99% of humanity doesn&#39;t need constant notifications and reminders on how to always perform at peak conditions&quot;<br><br>The moment Tim Cook said, &quot;doing more things for people&quot;, I started laughing, nobody needs an (mostly inaccurate at times too) x-ray, blood analysis device, heart beat calculation, calories intake, crash detection, etc etc on their wrist 24/7 telling them they&#39;re not okay lol"
Hi didn&#39;t answer a single question.
"Half of your questions should&#39;ve been: &quot;Sir, can you please answer the question?&quot;"
The magic mouse moment was hilarious
"They never gonna invite MKBHD again, because of the Magic Mouse question 😂😂"
Lol i don&#39;t think he was expecting the magic mouse mention.
🔥🔥🔥
Am I the only one who was nervous watching this interview??
so glad to see MKBHD interviewing small creator like Tim
I wish Tim Cook becomes a matchmaker after his stint at Apple. He can be really successful at helping people like me getting married 😅
Who the hell is that with MKBHD ?
I would like to know what Apple&#39;s B2B road map looks like next time you chat with Tim.  Genuinely appreciate your work.
"Sorry but the magic mouse IS a bad produt... The ergonomics and the way is charged is just BAD... Not the worst Apple product, but it is one of the worst 👎"
"With the concern on how bad Siri has been, I really wonder if this Apple Intelligent would be any good😢😢"
the magic mouse setup... 😂
They certanly got the ergonomics of the Magic mouse right. At least if the goal was to make it as painful as possible to use.
"Wow Marques, you‘ve really climbed the peak of technological content!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=731"">12:11</a> <br>Marques: The Magic Mouse 👀<br>Tim: 💀ahhhh…"
Tim also knows the magic mouse is really bad product 🤣🤣🤣
Why didn&#39;t he push back on the magic mouse bs? Bro is such a bootlicker.
Nice video 😎
Apple: all about privacy<br>Also Apple: old photos deleted on your device years ago come back to life
bro running out of words talking about magic mouse
Might be a wild guess. But the way Tim looked at your phone and you had to clarify it was the 15.. part of me makes me feel they already slid you a 16 to test and he didn&#39;t want to say it by accident
Tim tried so hard to dodge that magic mouse curveball 😭
Marques should really start a podcast.
Apple mouse and ergonomics should not be in the same sentence.
<b>gasp</b>
Magic Mouse got him startled
Crazy crossover right here
Very tame interview but understand why - would be interested next time to ask him what products that Apple doesn&#39;t offer in the tech space that he can&#39;t do without? Interesting insight into where Apple could partner or delve into potentially. Although these sort of engagements are well rehearsed / pre-empted
Wish you said iPod. Need them to make a new touch
I am glad Tim can talk to the best innovator of our time
"magic mouse and ergonomics moment🤣,  keeping a straight face, Hats off to u😆"
And now they kiss
This Tim Cook fellow looks a lot like Tim Apple.
Marques’s face when Tim started talking about the Magic Mouse ergonomics 😂
"LOOOOLLLLLLL🤣 The Magic Mouse, even the edit is different when speaking about Magic Mouse🤣🤣🤣🤣"
It&#39;s cool that Marques is giving people like Tim with a small platform a place to finally speak!
Seeing MKBHD keep a straight face while hearing Tim talk about the ergonomics of the magic mouse was the best moment of the interview
The Magic Mouse question is your trap card 😂
did he really just say ergonomics about magic mouse?
magic mouse is the best
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> the way cameraman focused the camera on Marques’s face to capture his reaction when Tim said ergonomics of Magic Mouse is hilarious 😝"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=333"">5:33</a> Tim almost couldn&#39;t tell which iphone Marques had 😂😂😂"
Marques trying not to laugh when Tim said &quot;getting the ergonomics good on the magic mouse was key&quot; is hilarious
I am so confused like why was he talking about screen on time and silencing the notification when he was asked about AI also the zooming when he asked for magic mouse&#39;s ranking was gold😂
The App Store created so many businesses
So… Marques sold out?
Lol magic mouse.
Ergonomic and Magic mouse shouldn&#39;t be in the same sentence..🙅🏽‍♂️
the pause on ergonomics on magic mouse
Awesome one!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> this is actually food for thought. Everybody is complaining about the iPad having all of this power and not being a “Mac” basically but Tim’s response is basically: this is the best tablet you can get. And… he is right ? There’s not a single tablet on the market that even comes close to the iPad."
Dude has become a sellout. What vanilla questions he asked. Sigh
لا إله إلا الله
Imagine marques walked in with a  pixel watch instead 😅
YOO SOME HARD QUESTIONS
Marques: &quot;What about the magic mouse?&quot;<br>Tim Cook: &quot;Uhh... It was also an incredible moment&quot;<br>Marques: 🤨
"A multi millionaire talks with a billionaire about things both have no idea about, modern YouTube for you."
This guy is slower than windows 2000
&quot;uhhh but the getting the       ergonomics... well done... and uh well was key&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=758"">12:38</a> man that comedic timing is just pure gold <br><br>Tim: put a a lot of thought into the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse <br><br>MBKHD: 😐"
honestly that interview was extremely underwhelming
Loved the &quot;Magic Mouse&quot; moment 😂
W<br><br>Last time I felt this proud is when Meek Mill was crying abt how DJ Akademiks is blackballing him<br><br>The pilgrimage to MKBHD is now a necessary prerequisite to ANY tech launch
Marques was really pushing Tim with his questions. He was not afraid to ask important questions. Love it!
"Tim was doing alright in the first half but kinda wished he shared more on the core creative aspects of how generative AI will compliment or negate the arts, music and fictional literature. The blind ranking fell in shambles though."
I wonder what happens if he instead held the S24 Ultra throughout the interview that I know he brought along to WWDC
"Magic Mouse... ground breaking? come on, Tim.... have you ever actually used one? 😄"
The disbelief on Marques&#39; Face when Tim mentions the &quot;superb ergonomics&quot; of the Magic Mouse is pure GOLD!
why is he wearing the watch on the right-hand
MKBHD face the whole interview 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Magic Mouse was hilarious !
the zoom in on Marques&#39;s face when Tim was talking about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse lmaooo
When he asked about the Magic Mouse though💀
<b>We&#39;ve got MKBHD and Tim cook collab before GTA VI</b>
And aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
The crop in on Marques&#39;s face when Tim is fumbling over the &quot;ergonimcs&quot; of the Magic Mouse... that thing is undefendable lol
This does feel like a curated interview - were the team given a series of areas that were off limits to questions?
This was so random sorry 😭😭. THe interview good tho.
This channel is becoming an Apple&#39;s ad channel.
The zoom-in when Tim said the paraphrase &quot;ergonomics was key&quot; for the magic mouse was gold hahaha.
the hesitation and camera zoom when discussing Magic Mouse 😂😂
That slow zooming in on Tim&#39;s face as he talked about the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse and then switching back to Marques&#39; face as he repeated &quot;ergonomics...&quot; had me dying 😭😭😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> ain&#39;t no he just said &quot;getting the ergonomics well done was key&quot;"
"Magic Mouse, nice one!"
Liked Cook&#39;s answer
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=745"">12:25</a> Bro was holding so hard not to laugh for the retrospective on the Magic Mouse 😂"
&quot;Ergonomics of Magic Mouse&quot;
The zoom during the magic mouse moment is hilarious
"From the iPad calculator app to this, we are in a new golden age of Apple!"
"Evidence of respect, power and influence held by Marques. He&#39;s not your typical youtuber"
His responses are horrible on almost every question. The freakin&#39; Magic Mouse was/is the most horrible product ever to have an Apple Logo.  He should admit that and fix it.
Lucky Ducky Tim
The camera zoom when the magic mouse situation came up! Wild
When we gonna see Tim Cook blind rank his family? 👀<br><br>Jk. This was a great interview with two incredible individuals. Thank you Marques and Tim for everything y’all put out into this world!
The Magic Mouse..? Yeah. He held back so hard
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=733"">12:13</a><br>Tim: The magic mouse ... ...<br>Marques:...<br>Tim: ... was also an incredible moment! ... *ergonomic*.<br>MKBHD: The magic mouse!?<br>Tim: Yes!"
God Tim Cook is so rehearsed. He couldn’t even do a blind ranking. Had to pull out the Apple press release for every product.
I don&#39;t know much about Tim but all I know is that he has an award for the worst F1 flag waving ever
I can&#39;t believe Marquess didn&#39;t ask Tim when they would be dropping those flight suits from the opening so that we can buy them
Wow tim got lucky there huh? congrats on 19mil
he really dodge ipad and magic mouse bit hahaha
Asking Tim about the Magic Mouse is diabolical
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> &quot;Getting the ergonomics well done...&quot; Marques looks like he&#39;s holding back laughter.  I love my Magic Mice for the touch function, but this thing is not ergonomic."
"Dear Marquees, your legacy will be the style, aesthetics and minimalism in tech videos."
Had to get the ergonomics right haha
Hopefully Apple Intelligence goes smooth without bumps unlike Bings AI
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=703"">11:43</a> &quot;Our objective is never to be first, our objective is to be best.&quot; 🔥"
I would have liked Tim to be honest about the magic mouse
Tim Cook really likes Nike :D
Great job on this interview with Tim Cook Marques
It&#39;s kinda funny seeing Marques with an iPhone here when he had a Samsung Galaxy in his WWDC recap video. Maybe he didn&#39;t wanna make Tim feel bad
man I wish I could be like him
"eecutives need to not do interviews. this was so cringe and asnwered none of the hard hitting questions, we need someone to nail him with the big questions like macOS on the ipad. emulators on ios and ipados. allowing other appstores. all this interview is marketing speak and not really answering any questions."
"how bad is one of the best representee, not best at all, i liked mickle fisher in interview better, if youtube community asks this soft question, why and what are u different about? ur sellout made difference no difference !"
&quot;So I&#39;ve been living with Tim Cook for about 2 weeks now&quot;
Tim talking about the Magic mouse is hilarious
Marques face when Tim said “Ergonomics” in reference to the Magic Mouse😂😂
okay so about that Magic Mouse...
Happy for MKBHD. He’s worked a long time to get to where he is now.
NAHHH NOT THE MAGIC MOUSE. i WAS CRACKING
MKBHD: The Magic Mouse...<br>Tim: Errrrr.....
🔥 🔥 🔥
Tim could&#39;ve been better
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> Bro couldnt even recognize which iphone it was bc every iphone is almost identical 💀"
The magic mouse 😂 MKBHD did Tim dirty😢
Felt like Tim didn’t know what Magic Mouse was 😭
apple: we just wanna make sure the best way to scam our users with the maximum price point..
apple saying they&#39;re dedicated to people spending less time on screens THE SAME YEAR that they launched the vision pro is hilarious.
"Lol, Tim praising the ergonomics of the magic mouse... does the man live under a rock?"
“Well. We didn’t get a blind ranking…” 😂😂😂
Ask him why ipad os is so outdated and weak in pair with is hardware 😂 📱 💻
How much did Apple pay you ?
"wtf, bro actually said magic mouse and ergonomics in the same sentence....."
“Our model doesn’t depend on engagement” lmao. Tell that to your “services” revenue
From this little Boy to Tim Cook.. WOW 🤩
Marques is a BEAST.
love Marques&#39; reaction when tim said ergonomics of magic mouse
Can we talk about the clean  intro and exit music?
Tim was so cringe in this. Time for him to move on.
Hahahaha the magic mouse part 😂😂😂
CEO of 19M Subscribers interviewing CEO of 19M subscribers
the magic mouse bit was hilarious XD
"Our objective is not to be first, it is to be the best. Those are some nice words from tim cook"
Sold out again.
What was bros list?
magic mouse haha
Love getting an interview with you and Justine! The two channels I always go too for new Apple content and opinions❤
The benefit to the user.... lol .. let&#39;s talk how many cores the chip has
lmao tim just refused to rank the products
Congrats on the interview ‼️‼️
shout out marques for not laughing at that answer about the magic mouse lmao
Marquees has done great this year collaborating with the biggest and influential people
Tim saying they worked hard on getting the ergonomics of the magic mouse right lmao oof.
"I understand Tim&#39;s point, but, there is a clear no. 6 in the product ranking."
The zoom in on Marques&#39; face when asking about Magic Mouse😂😂
"His effort to praise the Magic Mouse was incredible, it made me burst into laughter."
What about some challenging questions Marques ? I&#39;m sure you could find some... Missed opportunity
Tim talks so much without saying anything
Riley from LTT gonna have a field day with this vid.
"The Magic Mouse, uhhhhhhh &lt;stares into oblivion&gt;, it was also an incredible moment.<br>Marques: please kill me"
was he making sure it&#39;s iphone 15? lol
Magic mouse was personal 😂
One does have to wonder where Steve be on this with A.I and we&#39;re apple is now. I reckon he&#39;d be exactly the same to be honest
You can almost taste Elon Musk&#39;s salty tears 🥲
My butt puckered when Tim tried to grab the android phone and realized it wasn’t an iPhone 😂
"Tim: “Getting the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse so well done”<br>Marques: 🌝 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=767"">12:47</a>"
Apple closing down after this interview
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=762"">12:42</a> Marques’ face when he says “Getting the ergonomics well done was key” in reference to the Magic Mouse 😂"
"0.000001 femtoseconds, no views. Blud fell off."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> fifteen🙄😂"
nice of tim for promoting small creators
Wow he defined and answered the questions very well
"I said, &quot;le Tim Cook&quot;!!"
Great perspective on the new direction!
Love seeing big creators like Marques sitting down with smaller creators. What a a great way to introduce Tim Cook! Awesome interview.
Crazy that you got Tim Cook in
This guy really went from “13-Year-Old Golf Swing Analysis” to interviewing Tim Cook
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
always nice seeing Tim Apple
"Why dont you directly talk to <b>Sam Altman</b> instead,<br>when the Apple Intelligence means the <b>ChatGPT</b> intelligence.<br>😅😂"
A collab with MKBHD ? This is huge for Tim Apple ! Dude really took off !
Who’s more nervous? Marques or Tim? 😅
the magic mouse question 💀💀💀💀
tim ‘socks’ looks good
Uploading by 5 o&#39;clock is wild 😑😑
the magic mouse...
This is an important interview detailing the knowledge of Artificial  intelligence to educate people. <br>Marques continue to educate!🎉
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=732"">12:12</a> - I really hope you asked him to fix the charging port on the Magic Mouse behind the scene 😅"
The magic mouse 😂
The Magic Mouse. lol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=328"">5:28</a> I love how Tim checked if Marques&#39; phone was an iPhone 🤣"
Magic mouse 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
NOT THE MAGIC MOUSE
Integrated Chat gpt to the iPhone by the end of the year.....😢  Inproving people&#39;s lives???   ITunes will be selling AI music....
YouTube should fast forward at 2x when Tim starts speaking.
I knos this is off topic - but have you tried any of the android find my trackers? Apparently none of them are functioning as intended and are only working via bluetooth.
Look at that!  Tim talking to the most powerful man in tech!
Damm that Magic mouse question was something
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> LOL! Marques couldn’t handle it when Tim Cook emphasized the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=327"">5:27</a> even Tim Apple doesn’t know which iPhone is which"
The privacy part seemed like Tim didn’t give a straight answer. Mkbhd’s question was really good
Never! In a thousand years!!! I would even imagine him being so down to earth to collaborate with Tim Cook. Good for him!
the king walks naked <br>the words of nothing <br>spill from his lips
I see what he did with the magic mouse question. 😂😂
The zooms on the magic mouse section had me dying 😭😭😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=733"">12:13</a> 😂😂 ergonomics on priorities"
Did Tim think Marques had a non iPhone on the chair with him when he said “.well..” and then Marques showed him it was a 15. What on earth just happened there😅
blud is getting desperate going to a growing youtuber 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I dont think Tim understands how to blind rank?
Marques&#39;s face during the magic mouse segment is gold.
Tim can&#39;t help himself can he - completely incapable of discussing things in general terms.
654th
Doing an interview after beating Apple’s subscribers count is just cruel
When an interview with Craig?? Ask for his helmet 😂
Glad to see Tim Apple
The zoom in at magic mouse haha
Tim did NOT give a good answer to using Vision Pro. That says a lot about the use case of the product.
MKBHD and Tim Apple
Tim trying so hard to not rank the apple products is so hilarious 😅
Can you ask Tim if he can fix the Safari zoom bug? The one where little lines show up between DIVs when you zoom in. It’s about a 10 year old bug now.
"“I don’t look backwards, only forwards,” but then proceeds to only talk about the initial impact of different products in the ranking… which wasn’t even a ranking. seems like he didn’t want to compare the products to themselves 😂 it’s okay Tim we know iPhone is clearly #1"
uhh thanks tim apple
The magic mouse zoom-ins when tim talked about the ergonomics were perfect
"Funny, Elon Musk doesn&#39;t trust Open AI or chat gtp4. Yet Tim Cook welcomes them with open arms ? Hmm 🤔, some how I believe Elon has a better understanding of AI than Tim Cook does."
that long &quot;uhhhh&quot; pause while Tim tries to think of something good to say about the Magic Mouse was amazing. And then the cut to your face while Tim says &quot;getting the ergonomics right.&quot;
Tim absolutely bottled the blind ranking 🤦‍♂
Tim Cooked
magic mouse 😂
Mr. Cook side stepped the whole Blind Ranking game so smoothly. really shows how deeply people like him are prepared to face any situation during interviews.
"Thanks for giving Tim a platform, he needs it."
Marque&#39;s reaction to Tim saying how &quot;ErGoNoMiC&quot; the Magic Mouse is has me packing AHAHAHHA
MKBHD has been giving those people the opportunity to be heard.💯
A question I would have asked: “have you ever been using your phone and wish it had a feature? What was it and did you have it pushed to be added to iOS”
"like the comment if you want happiness in your life<br><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/DfgfY9LaNdmMq7IPuI2AaA""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/zPgfY66lCJGRhL0Pz6iA4Aw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UvgfY_vqE92T29sPvqiAkAU""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/7cIfY5niDOmSkNAP08CA6A4""></a>"
Good mornaaangg everyone
The ergonomics in the magic mouse 😂
Its like Ravish kumar and narendra modi pc actually happening😂😂😂
Dang Tim talking tech and AI with MKBHD
"Did he rank them? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=766"">12:46</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=732"">12:12</a> Marques not the Magic Mouse 😭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=320"">5:20</a> was Tim unsure whether that was an iphone 15, lmao"
Tim cook wants to secure his stock prices before MKBHD makes his video
"*Tim Apple,"
Did Tim just... Cook?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Except for the magic mouse stuff.
It&#39;s amazing that Marques would use his platform to give a voice to up and coming content creators like Tim.
Even Tim didn&#39;t know what model the iPhone was without seeing the cameras.
Leave it to Tim&#39;s PR to ruin a good game at the end
"like the comment if you want happiness in your life<br><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/DfgfY9LaNdmMq7IPuI2AaA""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/zPgfY66lCJGRhL0Pz6iA4Aw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UvgfY_vqE92T29sPvqiAkAU""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/7cIfY5niDOmSkNAP08CA6A4""></a>"
Tim Cook is AI
He tried so hard on the Magic Mouse 😅
Crazy how MKBHD took the time out of his busy calendar just to talk with Tim Cook!
They’re never gonna fix the mouse….
Idk why but I feel like Tim doesn&#39;t know shit about AI
Tim cooked sounds like a badly trained ai language model
"MKBHD started cooking in 2008 and has not stopped , now he is with Tim Cook"
LOL He refused to do a ranking
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=734"">12:14</a> those zooms on Marques hahaha"
"Marques is not afraid to ask the important questions, and follow up on vague answers. Nice to see 👏"
This was so better interview. Asking the right questions. Not fangirling like stupid iJustine
"Great video, love how Tim is confident in the future of Apple. Way to go!"
"Damn, the age of Linux might has begun."
"Well done Apple, listen to him"
"Did you floss? 😅😂😮😅 best Softball game, since Oklahoma vs Texas 😮 ... infomercial on foxnews level... mypillow ad."
"The older guy looks like he know a lot about apple, maybe he could work there someday"
Tim must be so glad for having the opportunity to talk to Marques
These comments are the best lol MK finally giving Tim an interview 😂
"tim is a good interviewer, he really shed some light on MKBHDs ideas and thoughts"
He sounds like a CEO.  Answers a bit convoluted and slippery.. I do love that Marques has so much sway that the big guys want to talk with him!
Tim pats phone:<br>Marques: “Yeah. It’s the 15 😑”<br>Love seeing MKBHD still continuously growing and watching these big names in tech express their respect and support for Marques and his team’s work and dedication to their craft!
Someone send this to Elon musk so he understands it’s safe 😂
"I was absolutely dying at the Magic Mouse segment. The zoom-ins, the &quot;ergonomics&quot;, the look on Marques&#39; face as he was so obviously biting is tongue -- hilarious!"
Marques casually meeting some of the most powerful people on the planet 😅
tim is about to get cooked 💀
Really excellent interview 👌🏻
"Should have asked him was the AI that heavy that it couldn&#39;t run on iPhone 15 pro and below line up at least 14 pro? didn&#39;t seem that impressive to require an A17 pro, making iPhone 14 pro miss out on meaningful updates and features making their 7-10 years updates a gimmick for all the models below it. Truly an apple moment 👏👏👏"
They cooked
"Not a small world but a tech world, the conversation is mutual not someone begging for paycheck"
From Cheerios to this. Congrats.
"Curious about the production of something like this. Does Apple set up the mics, cameras, lighting, etc? Or do you bring your team/equipment?"
Nice point about legacy by Tim
Tim Cook For President!
Tim Cook out here showing up at every tech YouTubers channel after this year&#39;s WWDC
not a great interview tbh
"Dear Tim, have you ever dreamt of sitting and talking with MKBHD in your life? How&#39;s your feelings about this dream come true?"
Iphone se 4 👏👏😢
Boring.
TIM COOK 😳
Magic Mouse and ergonomics in the same sentence 🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=326"">5:26</a> 😂😂😂"
I came here for the magic mouse moment.
10-minute gang<br> 👇
did u ask him for the bag
if you are trapped like me with your phone and aint doing nothing the whole day then like this comment
Listening to Tim double down on the Magic Mouse whilst the camera zooms in on Marques’ smug face was very satisfying.
I&#39;m so glad the Marques gave Tim the opportunity to get some exposure. Amazing to see such a humble creator!
A casual meeting.
Magic Mouse 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> even tim cook cant tell the differnce between iPhone versions 😭"
This actually scares me
Marques threw a curveball with the magic mouse 🤣
It’s Tim Apple
Yea bro Let tim .. COOK 🔥
"TIM, GOT TO TALK TO MARQUES????? wow. Just wow."
His voice makes me feel like there is a snail crawling on my skin.
"Love that apple is taking YouTube creators seriously, shows you how far YouTube has come and all the credit goes to content creators like Marques."
MKBHD x Tim interview??? lets gooo!!!
I know what you did with that 37 seconds of intro 😂
&quot;ergonomics&quot; hmmm
Tim Cook. The 🐐.
doing for people 🤡🤡
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=763"">12:43</a> Magic mouse ergonomics was well done😂lol"
Best interview by far. (We&#39;ve seen iJustine and SuperSaf)
Only Marquees can ask Tim why Apple uses &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; instead of &quot;Artificial Intelligence.&quot; 🤣
Too bad he didn&#39;t try the &quot;why are you gay&quot; on him. LOL
Shoutout to Marques for providing small entrepreneurs like Tim with a platform to reach a wider audience.
I Hope Tim will get a chance at working with MKBHD... He Seems to be a nice guy....
I don’t know if you are living the dream or they also dream of seeing themselves next to you
So glad MKBHD is giving opportunities for smaller creators to collaborate with him 🥰
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> lol on twitter, people were conspiring that the smartphone on MKBHD&#39;s armrest was an Android 😅😆"
Why didn&#39;t you use the S24 for your notes??😅
Bro casually meeting final boss 🤧
"Ergonomics of the Magic Mouse, uh... Tim, let me ask, have you ever actually... uhm... used one?"
Why wear an Apple watch and wave around an iPhone that says &quot;I&#39;m a big Apple fan&quot; - Wouldn&#39;t it have been better not to put your cards on the table?
STOP GLAZING
Cu mine nu a vrut sa vorbească TIM 😮te tin eu minte 😢
"The time has come to retire. Thanks for everything Tim, but now go. 🙏"
“A legacy is something defined by other people not something you define yourself” He ate there
Tim Apple!
IOS 18: The android update 😂😂😂😂
I can&#39;t stop seeing VVV in the background
"Apple has created the most advanced Ai, I’ve ever seen. This Tim model is so advanced"
Now we can be sure that Marques is 100% guaranteed to be part of the Aluminati.
10/10
"i just heard Tim in here, he must be a big creators that can have a chance to talk to Marques"
typical ceo saying a lot without saying anything lol
Who is this guy MKBHD is talking to?
"smiles for smiles in life.<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw""></a>"
love how Marques helps the small company gain exposure
long time harvesting data now be best apple intelligence 😂
Tim finally got to meet MKBHD
are you going to make iOS 18 preview video?
Marques bringing an iPhone even though his main phone nowadays is the s24 Ultra🤣
But… what were his rankings? He never actually said
Marques is coooking with Tim
Tim &quot;Matte Black&quot; Apple
You are getting close to Apple&#39;s subscribers
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX2cQdPubk&amp;t=112"">1:52</a> this laugh from Tim actually means &quot;bro you&#39;re exposing us wtf&quot;😂"
When Tim said “you’re wearing a watch” and the marques placing the android phone on the side 😂😂😂
MKBHD talks to the man he is about to beat in subs!
Now we&#39;re cooking 😅
Marques interviewing all big tech CEOs like collecting Infinity Stones
1 like equals 1 push up 😂 how many do you want me to do
"Amazing video, so glad you had the opportunity MKBHD. Love Tim’s PR training on refusing the rankings"
every bone in his body telling him not to roast the mouse
LOGIC 🔥🔥
Nice paid sponsorship
"Amazing man!, great job Marques, were you any more nervous than usual? not that you show it or anything?"
Yes!!!! the collab we&#39;ve all been waiting for!
Congrats to smaller creators like Tim Apple making it big!
T H E   E R G O N O M I C S
HE SAID AI
"i like the podcast-style of the Video, pls more!"
&quot;The Magic Mouse. Ok&quot;
Marques giving small creators like Tim a big audience what a nice guy
Why does it seem like  Tim is saying a whole lot of nothing
i am also glad that tim got this opportunity to talk to mkbhd
Tim is so hyped about this interview with Marques Nice 😊
Imagine marques interviewing Steve Jobs
Apple joining hands with Open AI is the biggest security threat in the smartphone world.<br>I really hope Congress steps in and BAN iPhone&#39;s sales if this madness continues.
He says it was hard figuring out the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse😐. <br><br>Are we on the same planet 😂
"Meh last apple device i had was the iphone 4, I dont think i would ever get another one let alone a laptop or anything else they sell, garbage"
Shoulda asked him why we can’t get black air pods
Love his take on it
"With Tim in charge, I wonder why they don&#39;t harness the potential limitless power of the perpetual motion machine that is Steve Jobs constantly rolling over in his grave."
"sad that these cannot be harder hitting questions, good interview nonetheless"
Regardless of where you stand on privacy and security one thing is undoubtable;<br><br>Apple&#39;s integration of ARTIFICIAL Intelligence in their products is better than any other consumer products to date.
This is great! I wonder if Apple Intelligence will have a chat bot like ChatGPT with multiple chats or if it’s just Siri 😅
Tim “Cooked”
Did he cook
MKBHD is cooking as always!
Let Tim Cook?
Let tim cook
So Nice!
The zoom ins while they talked about the magic mouse 😭😭
"Apple &quot;AI&quot;... I wonder what Apple actually can get away with...is no one just a little sceptic, or do everybody just takes every word they are saying for good???😮"
This is awesome man. Congratulations.
glod job Marquez
Tim doesn’t understand product. He’s an operations guy .
Just starting the vid. I hope you held his feet to the fire
Why do you call it AI now - it’s not abt the technology - sure
Let Tim Cook !
Tim sounds more nervous to talk to Marques than Marques does to Tim 😂
SEND ME ONE S24 ULTRA
Nice
Let Tim Cook!
I&#39;m always waiting for the new apple mouse (please fix it)
Hope MKBHD gives a ❤
what a simp.. f apple.  I think Elon got it right this time.  Not to mention all these apple fans insulting Microsoft&#39;s version while simping for cook.
‪But no mention of how they&#39;re exploiting the people of Congo ‬and funding the IDF… should I be surprised a black man disappointing us…smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
let tim cook
Let Tim Cook
Elon intensifies
Was really hopping you&#39;d ask about the calculator
What if thats just Riley from Techlinked doing a really good impression...
👊
"Marques you need to investigate 65square, the world&#39;s healthiest socials."
bro got Tim Apple on the show 😱
Such an amazing opportunity for Tim Cook!
Tim didn&#39;t cook this time
How do you feel about handing all of your data over to Microsoft through openAI?
I got a question. Why does my Watch Series 6 not support Double Tap? I use quick actions all the time.
I love MKBHD reactions to some of Cook&#39;s answers
Having a field day at the WWDC &#39;all new&#39; announcements and then interviewing the CEO. Mad Lad :D
"&quot;We see bla bla bla&quot;, you bend &quot;ai&quot; to your advantage, naming it &quot;apple intelligence&quot;, you bought ai services from openai... What did you see?"
what was said behind the scenes?😊
Did Tim looked at your Samsung S24 Ultra?
I like how logo says Volkswagen DC 2024.
“We didn’t want to say AI so we could wait until we could brand our own” -The Cook
THE Tim Apple?!
Big moment for Tim
Marques let him cook
IF we use AI for profit we will never get anywhere with AI
"MKBHD being the only interview to make Tim Cook think about his answers was so perfect, great questions!"
Impressed you got this man. GJ!
Now let&#39;s listen to a connaisseur 😊
Marquess is definetly on the illuminati good list
Apple may be late to the party- but does the party truly start until they’re there?
Love this they are leading with transparency
Just imagine another world where it was Steve Jobs sitting down with Marques. Now THAT would have been interesting!
Does he know you&#39;ve become MKPHD?
Finally something interesting at WWDC!
This is awesome. Man like Tim Cook.
Looks like MKBHD left the S24 Ultra in the pocket for this interview.
Marques collecting Tech CEOs like Pokemon.
Mentioning ‘Ergonomics’ and ‘Magic Mouse’ in the same sentence is insane
Apple Intelligence does not roll of the tongue. We&#39;ll see if this post age well. 😏
comment no. 94: just for algorithm.
Tim Cook got the opportunity to talk to MKBHD!
Best video ever ❤
Apple 2024 : we can change homescreen icon colour😂😂
Would be really funny if Tim landed in the studio from a parachute wearing a skydiving jumpsuit.

Tim is very good at not answering the questions but making it feel like he did
"Crazy interview, just felt like there was a wall between yall lol"
Tim is becoming popular
The moment I was about to close YouTube
Bro is gonna bag Steve Jobs for an interview next
What he cookin 🫨
what a collab
Here first from Nigeria 🇳🇬
AI = Apple Intelligence 🥳
Tim cook is a bu m. He doesn&#39;t innovate. Only a YES MAN TO THE SHAREHOLDERS. Bring in a CEO that actually contributes. Apple is a shell of itself
Whole ass 63 year old CEO of a technology company and rocking nikes
😅
The best AI evaaa…..😂😂
Biggest W
Artificial Intelligence ❌<br>Apple Intelligence ✅ <br><br>LoL😂 The Market skills 🥶
MKBHD is the industry leader in tech news and reviews. Amazing how far this channel has come. In my opinion he&#39;s overtaken CNET and Engadget.
"Tim is being pushing the rainbow a lot lately: watch band, socks… that is how you remember we are in the month."
"Tims &quot;great to see you&quot; is so pleasant, and just reminds me of all his greetings in the Apple Events."
Like this comment if you want the Artemis mission to go well.
talking tech tim cook!
Thanks for giving Tim a platform to speak on
Marquess x Tim Cook: most awaited podcast ❤
elmo marques shitting bricks rn
"Why is no-one talking about the breakthrough keyboard in the vision pro, it wasn’t said in the presentation but in the slide it was there"
let tim cook
NO WAY THAT MKBHD MET TIM COOK! That’s awesome
seems you connected supersaf
Such heartwarming that such a big YouTuber like MBKHD is giving the chance for a CEO of a small company to talk.
“Good Morning!”
"Jokes aside, it&#39;s really cool that Craig &amp; Tim have been willing to sit down with Marques for these kind of interviews. You can pick it apart all you want, but at the end of the day, this kind of stuff is still extremely rare to see."
"I swear bro, Apple is some scammers that are allowed to do so, It&#39;s nothing but a software update."
Great interview😊
MKBHD ❤
Now you will love all apple products....
You know you made it when you get to talk tech with MKBHD!
Can you tell Tim to get back to cooking please
COOL!
Now this is big!
Our boy is a top tier tech journalist 🥹
A great moment for Tim Cook!
Great content but yeah Apple&#39;s got a deal with him to do videos for them
Cook tim <br>Tim cool
"So, I have been having Tim Cook for the past few weeks, and here is my first impression."
first
Let Tim cook
Who let Tim cook? 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hope one day the chairs would reverse!
Are we talking about AI or AI?🤔
"Fan fact : if you double tap this comment, I will give you ……."
I&#39;m surprised apple didn&#39;t call their machine learning iA
"Ah yes, my favorite. “Apple Intelligence” 😂😂"
The only Tim Cook interview I was looking forward to!
"Anyone notice how in the new ios 18, the flashlight on the newer iPhone like the 14 pro and the 15 pro the flashlight now has the ability to focus and spread the light on top of adjusting the brightness. and the dynamic island animation is dope"
impressive to see how far the passionate little kid in his bedroom has come !
Crazy that MKBHD started off as a teen who loves to talk about tech to a massive channel that speaks with CEOS of the biggest companies in the world.
In the beginning 😅
"Ok Marques, you’re in the big league 💯"
MKBHD so kind to let Tim on for an interview
Where&#39;s the S24 Ultra you shot your first pic at WWDC with? Too scared tim would show you the door if you would&#39;ve pulled that out? LMAO
Tim got some nice shoes lol. Better than .254&#39;s imo🪤
Didn’t see that’s coming 😊
Tim Apple
Never been more loyal to a content creator
"he got to cook with Tim, nice!"
"Let&#39;s be honest, Tim is currently using the iPhone 16 Pro Max.😂"
"if this interview doesn&#39;t touch base on elitist in hollywood and if Tim has a part in that, then I&#39;m unsubscribing."
"so when you have 19 million subscribers and impact like marques you get to spend time with tim cook? pretty neat, but also shows how far out of reach it is for most normal people. glad youtube exists and we get to watch it for free."
tim cooked
"Tim Cook is the worst thing to happen to Apple. YA, I SAID IT!!!!"
Aiiiiiii ApPle iNteLliGenCe 🤣
Sundar Pichai ✅️<br>Mark Zuckenberg ✅️<br>Satya Nadella ✅️<br>Tim Cook ✅️
Before 100
"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God"
First
MKBhd interviewing Tim Cook before GTA 6
"Apple is so afraid of MKBHD mocking their releases/announcements that they sent Tim to make sure they PROPERLY explain and make sure he&#39;s on point. And still did not buy it, still took a Samsung phone to the keynote. But an iPhone to this meeting. Haha. 😅"
Man he&#39;s getting old. His voice is breaking. Not even last year it was not like this. Feels bad him like this !
"Apple &quot;invented&quot; things, without doing jackshit for a solid 15 years now.<br><br>Most of it is copy pasting something that&#39;s already been done by the Android community, tweaking it a little, just a little, and calling it innovative."
1 hour gang c:
I just like the Maths bit and all the trauma I could’ve avoided in class.
Bruh the hell is apple intelligence 😂
"Dude, it‘s Tim Apple"
Jealous Tim got to meet MKBHD
i wonder if he&#39;ll ask why a 900 dollar phone still has 60hz and why a 1000 dollar laptop comes with 8gb ram and why improving storage and ram costs 200 dollars
2 mins ago is crazy
Love you guys ❤
this is insane
woah this is crazy
Second
Who&#39;s early today?<br><br>.. Me!
"That’s 19 million - and potentially some musk tweets - for you.  <br><br>And Tim, don’t think that ‘they/them’ BS nonsense in your demo wasn’t noticed !!"
Another Apple fanboi 🤦
Vote here for Marques to be the next apple CEO:
"I’m not even joking, I turned on notifications for this channel five minutes ago, and after, he immediately posts"
So glad Tim was able to meet THE Marques Brownlee
Use me as a Tim Cook &quot;uhhh&quot; button
Timmy and the Big Guy.
It&#39;s been a normal or a routine ... MKBHD to meet these CEO&#39;s
The Cult Guru vibe of this individual is concerning...
😂
Wish older phones would also get the Siri upgrades with ios 18 😔
Tim is taking big strides. Getting the opportunity to talk to Marquess
Lets gooo
Let Tim COOK 🔥😮‍💨
Calculator coming To I-pad is the most nostalgic thing to me!
Who else loves MKBHD’s videos ?
EARLY &lt;3
"Imagine if he accidentally pulled out his Android phone, instead of the iPhone."
1 min is crazy
wonder if tim will mention the word &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; instead of apple Intelligence throughout this vid.
No way Marques go to talk to THE Tim Cook

Love you marques
"This does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos."
Irst comment
37 seconds ago is crazy (right)
AI is just a buzzword nowadays. Its definitely overhyped.
